28052099	Effects of Thermal Regimes, Starvation and Age on Heat Tolerance of the Parthenium Beetle Zygogramma bicolorata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) following Dynamic and Static Protocols.	Temperature and resource availability are key elements known to limit the occurrence and survival of arthropods in the wild. In the current era of climate change, critical thermal limits and the factors affecting these may be of particular importance. We therefore investigated the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) of adult Zygogramma bicolorata beetles, a biological control agent for the invasive plant Parthenium hysterophorus, in relation to thermal acclimation, hardening, age, and food availability using static (constant) and dynamic (ramping) protocols. Increasing temperatures and exposure times reduced heat survival. In general, older age and lack of food reduced heat tolerance, suggesting an important impact of resource availability. Acclimation at constant temperatures did not affect CTmax, while fluctuating thermal conditions resulted in a substantial increase. Hardening at 33°C and 35°C improved heat survival in fed young and mid-aged but only partly in old beetles, while CTmax remained unaffected by hardening throughout. These findings stress the importance of methodology when assessing heat tolerance. Temperature data recorded in the field revealed that upper thermal limits are at least occasionally reached in nature. Our results therefore suggest that the occurrence of heat waves may influence the performance and survival of Z. bicolorata, potentially impacting on its field establishment and effectiveness as a biological control agent.

28052098	IDH1 R132H Mutation Enhances Cell Migration by Activating AKT-mTOR Signaling Pathway, but Sensitizes Cells to 5-FU Treatment as NADPH and GSH Are Reduced.	AIM OF STUDY: Mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) gene were recently discovered in vast majority of World Health Organization (WHO) grade II/III gliomas. This study is to understand the effects of IDH1 R132H mutation in gliomagenesis and to develop new strategies to treat glioma with IDH1 R132H mutation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over expression of IDH1 R132H in U87MG cells was done by transfecting cells with IDH1 R132H plasmid. MTT assay, scratch repair assay and western blot were performed to study effects of IDH1 R132H mutation on cell proliferation, migration, regulating AKT-mTOR signaling pathway and cell death respectively. NADP+/NADPH and GSH quantification assays were performed to evaluate effects of IDH1 R132H mutation on the production of antioxidant NADPH and GSH.RESULTS: We found that over expression of IDH1 R132H mutation decreased cell proliferation consistent with previous reports; however, it increased cell migration and enhanced AKT-mTOR signaling pathway activation. Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 also change the function of the enzymes and cause them to produce 2-hydroxyglutarate and not produce NADPH. We tested the level of NADPH and GSH and demonstrated that IDH1 R132H mutant stable cells had significantly low NADPH and GSH level compared to control or IDH1 wild type stable cells. The reduced antioxidants (NADPH and GSH) sensitized U87MG cells with IDH R132H mutant to 5-FU treatment.CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the important role of IHD1 R132H mutant in up- regulating AKT-mTOR signaling pathway and enhancing cell migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IDH1 R132H mutation affects cellular redox status and sensitizes gliomas cells with IDH1 R132H mutation to 5FU treatment.	NA	0
28052097	The Natural Flavonoid Fisetin Inhibits Cellular Proliferation of Hepatic, Colorectal, and Pancreatic Cancer Cells through Modulation of Multiple Signaling Pathways.	Digestive cancers are major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Fisetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, has been previously shown anti-proliferative, anti-cancer, neuroprotective, and antioxidant activities. In our study, the anti-tumor activities in addition to regulatory effects of fisetin on some cancer cell lines were investigated. Data presented here showed that fisetin induces growth inhibition, and apoptosis in hepatic (HepG-2), colorectal (Caco-2) and pancreatic (Suit-2) cancer cell lines. Gene expression results showed that 1307 genes were significantly regulated in their expression in hepatic and pancreatic cell lines. 350 genes were commonly up-regulated and 353 genes were commonly down-regulated. Additionally, 604 genes were oppositely expressed in both tumor cells. CDK5 signaling, NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response, glucocorticoid signaling, and ERK/MAPK signaling were among most prominent signaling pathways modulating the growth inhibitory effects of fisetin on hepatic and pancreatic cancer cells. The present analysis showed, for the first time, that the anti-tumor effect of fisetin was mediated mainly through modulation of multiple signaling pathways and via activation of CDKN1A, SEMA3E, GADD45B and GADD45A and down-regulation of TOP2A, KIF20A, CCNB2 and CCNB1 genes.

28052096	Sex Determination from Fragmented and Degenerated DNA by Amplified Product-Length Polymorphism Bidirectional SNP Analysis of Amelogenin and SRY Genes.	Sex determination is important in archeology and anthropology for the study of past societies, cultures, and human activities. Sex determination is also one of the most important components of individual identification in criminal investigations. We developed a new method of sex determination by detecting a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the amelogenin gene using amplified product-length polymorphisms in combination with sex-determining region Y analysis. We particularly focused on the most common types of postmortem DNA damage in ancient and forensic samples: fragmentation and nucleotide modification resulting from deamination. Amplicon size was designed to be less than 60 bp to make the method more useful for analyzing degraded DNA samples. All DNA samples collected from eight Japanese individuals (four male, four female) were evaluated correctly using our method. The detection limit for accurate sex determination was determined to be 20 pg of DNA. We compared our new method with commercial short tandem repeat analysis kits using DNA samples artificially fragmented by ultraviolet irradiation. Our novel method was the most robust for highly fragmented DNA samples. To deal with allelic dropout resulting from deamination, we adopted &quot;bidirectional analysis,&quot; which analyzed samples from both sense and antisense strands. This new method was applied to 14 Jomon individuals (3500-year-old bone samples) whose sex had been identified morphologically. We could correctly identify the sex of 11 out of 14 individuals. These results show that our method is reliable for the sex determination of highly degenerated samples.	NA	0
28052095	Metabolomic Profiling in Individuals with a Failing Kidney Allograft.	BACKGROUND: Alteration of certain metabolites may play a role in the pathophysiology of renal allograft disease.METHODS: To explore metabolomic abnormalities in individuals with a failing kidney allograft, we analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS; for ex vivo profiling of serum and urine) and two dimensional correlated spectroscopy (2D COSY; for in vivo study of the kidney graft) 40 subjects with varying degrees of chronic allograft dysfunction stratified by tertiles of glomerular filtration rate (GFR; T1, T2, T3). Ten healthy non-allograft individuals were chosen as controls.RESULTS: LC-MS/MS analysis revealed a dose-response association between GFR and serum concentration of tryptophan, glutamine, dimethylarginine isomers (asymmetric [A]DMA and symmetric [S]DMA) and short-chain acylcarnitines (C4 and C12), (test for trend: T1-T3 = p&lt;0.05; p = 0.01; p&lt;0.001; p = 0.01; p = 0.01; p&lt;0.05, respectively). The same association was found between GFR and urinary levels of histidine, DOPA, dopamine, carnosine, SDMA and ADMA (test for trend: T1-T3 = p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01; p = 0.001; p&lt;0.05; p = 0.001; p&lt;0.001; p&lt;0.01, respectively). In vivo 2D COSY of the kidney allograft revealed significant reduction in the parenchymal content of choline, creatine, taurine and threonine (all: p&lt;0.05) in individuals with lower GFR levels.CONCLUSIONS: We report an association between renal function and altered metabolomic profile in renal transplant individuals with different degrees of kidney graft function.

28052094	Association between Polymorphisms in Antioxidant Genes and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.	Inflammation is the driving force in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its link to oxidative stress and carcinogenesis has long been accepted. The antioxidant system of the intestinal mucosa in IBD is compromised resulting in increased oxidative injury. This defective antioxidant system may be the result of genetic variants in antioxidant genes, which can represent susceptibility factors for IBD, namely Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the antioxidant genes SOD2 (rs4880) and GPX1 (rs1050450) were genotyped in a Portuguese population comprising 436 Crohn's disease and 367 ulcerative colitis patients, and 434 healthy controls. We found that the AA genotype in GPX1 is associated with ulcerative colitis (OR = 1.93, adjusted P-value = 0.037). Moreover, we found nominal significant associations between SOD2 and Crohn's disease susceptibility and disease subphenotypes but these did not withstand the correction for multiple testing. These findings indicate a possible link between disease phenotypes and antioxidant genes. These results suggest a potential role for antioxidant genes in IBD pathogenesis and should be considered in future association studies.	NA	0
28052093	Bone Morphogenetic Protein-9 Enhances Osteogenic Differentiation of Human Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells via the JNK Pathway.	Bone morphogenetic protein-9 (BMP9) shows great osteoinductive potential in bone regeneration. Periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) with multi-differentiation capability and low immunogenicity are increasingly used as seed cells for periodontal regenerative therapies. In the present study, we investigated the potent osteogenic activity of BMP9 on human PDLSCs (hPDLSCs), in which the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is possibly involved. Our results showed that JNK inhibition by the specific inhibitor SP600125 or adenovirus expressing small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting JNK (AdR-si-JNK) significantly decreased BMP9-induced gene and protein expression of early and late osteogenic markers, such as runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopontin (OPN), and osteocalcin (OCN), in hPDLSCs. We also confirmed the in-vivo positive effect of JNKs on ectopic bone formation induced by hPDLSCs injected into the musculature of athymic nude mice and BMP9 ex vivo gene delivery. For the cellular mechanism, we found that BMP9 activated the phosphorylation of JNKs and Smad2/3, and that JNKs may engage in cross-talk with the Smad2/3 pathway in BMP9-mediated osteogenesis.	NA	0
28052083	Pregnancy Outcomes after Treatment for Cervical Cancer Precursor Lesions: An Observational Study.	OBJECTIVE: To examine whether surgical procedures involving the uterine cervix were associated with pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, cesarean delivery and pregnancy loss.DESIGN: Population-based observational study nested in retrospective matched cohort.SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northwest integrated health plan in Oregon/Washington, U.S.A.POPULATION: Female health plan members age 14-53 years with documented pregnancies from 1998-2009. Women with prior excisional and ablative cervical surgical procedures (N = 322) were compared to women unexposed to cervical procedures (N = 4,307) and, separately, to those having undergone only diagnostic/biopsy procedures (N = 847).METHODS: Using log-linear regression models, we examined risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in relation to prior excisional or ablative cervical surgical procedures. We stratified excisional procedures by excision thickness. We evaluated for confounding by age, body mass index, race, smoking history, previous preterm birth, and parity.RESULTS: We found a positive association between excisional treatment &gt; = 1.0 cm and the outcomes preterm birth and low birth weight (preterm birth unadjusted risk ratio [RR] = 2.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-3.98 for excisions ≥1.0 cm compared to unexposed women), particularly in women who delivered within one year of surgery (RR = 3.26, 95% CI 1.41-7.53). There was no clear association between excisional treatment and cesarean delivery, and treated women did not have a substantially higher risk of dysfunctional labor. Ablative treatment was not associated with low birth weight, preterm birth, or cesarean delivery but was associated with pregnancy loss (RR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.05-1.93 vs. unexposed women). Analyses using the diagnostic procedures comparison group produced similar results.CONCLUSION: Women with &gt; = 1.0 cm excisional treatment had elevated risk of preterm birth and low birth weight when compared to unexposed women and women with cervical diagnostic procedures. This suggests that increased risk derives from the treatment itself, not from other characteristics. The observed association between pregnancy loss and ablative surgical treatment requires further investigation.	NA	0
28050012	PPAR-delta promotes survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in energetically unfavorable conditions.	Targeting the mechanisms that allow Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) cells to survive in harsh cancer microenvironments should improve patient outcomes. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta (PPARδ) sustains other cancers and in silico analysis showed higher PPARD expression in CLL cells than normal lymphocytes and other hematologic cancers. A direct association was found between PPARδ protein levels in CLL cells and clinical score. Transgenic expression of PPARδ increased the growth and survival of CD5(+) Daudi cells and primary CLL cells in stressful conditions including exhausted tissue culture media, low extracellular glucose, hypoxia, and exposure to cytotoxic drugs. Glucocorticoids and synthetic PPARδ agonists up-regulated PPARD expression and also protected Daudi and primary CLL cells from metabolic stressors. Survival in low glucose was related to increased antioxidant expression, substrate utilization, and mitochondrial performance and was reversed by genetic deletion and synthetic PPARδ antagonists. These findings suggest PPARδ conditions CLL cells to survive in harsh microenvironmental conditions by reducing oxidative stress and increasing metabolic efficiency. Targeting PPARδ may be beneficial in the treatment of CLL.Leukemia accepted article preview online, 04 January 2017. doi:10.1038/leu.2016.395.	NA	0
28052061	Integrated genomic characterization of oesophageal carcinoma.	Oesophageal cancers are prominent worldwide; however, there are few targeted therapies and survival rates for these cancers remain dismal. Here we performed a comprehensive molecular analysis of 164 carcinomas of the oesophagus derived from Western and Eastern populations. Beyond known histopathological and epidemiologic distinctions, molecular features differentiated oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas from oesophageal adenocarcinomas. Oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas resembled squamous carcinomas of other organs more than they did oesophageal adenocarcinomas. Our analyses identified three molecular subclasses of oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas, but none showed evidence for an aetiological role of human papillomavirus. Squamous cell carcinomas showed frequent genomic amplifications of CCND1 and SOX2 and/or TP63, whereas ERBB2, VEGFA and GATA4 and GATA6 were more commonly amplified in adenocarcinomas. Oesophageal adenocarcinomas strongly resembled the chromosomally unstable variant of gastric adenocarcinoma, suggesting that these cancers could be considered a single disease entity. However, some molecular features, including DNA hypermethylation, occurred disproportionally in oesophageal adenocarcinomas. These data provide a framework to facilitate more rational categorization of these tumours and a foundation for new therapies.	diagnostic	1

28052056	Genome-wide in vivo screen identifies novel host regulators of metastatic colonization.	Metastasis is the leading cause of death for cancer patients. This multi-stage process requires tumour cells to survive in the circulation, extravasate at distant sites, then proliferate; it involves contributions from both the tumour cell and tumour microenvironment ('host', which includes stromal cells and the immune system). Studies suggest the early steps of the metastatic process are relatively efficient, with the post-extravasation regulation of tumour growth ('colonization') being critical in determining metastatic outcome. Here we show the results of screening 810 mutant mouse lines using an in vivo assay to identify microenvironmental regulators of metastatic colonization. We identify 23 genes that, when disrupted in mouse, modify the ability of tumour cells to establish metastatic foci, with 19 of these genes not previously demonstrated to play a role in host control of metastasis. The largest reduction in pulmonary metastasis was observed in sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) transporter spinster homologue 2 (Spns2)-deficient mice. We demonstrate a novel outcome of S1P-mediated regulation of lymphocyte trafficking, whereby deletion of Spns2, either globally or in a lymphatic endothelial-specific manner, creates a circulating lymphopenia and a higher percentage of effector T cells and natural killer (NK) cells present in the lung. This allows for potent tumour cell killing, and an overall decreased metastatic burden.	NA	2
28049849	CD4 T-cell cytokines synergize to induce proliferation of malignant and nonmalignant innate intraepithelial lymphocytes.	Refractory celiac disease type II (RCDII) is a severe complication of celiac disease (CD) characterized by the presence of an enlarged clonal population of innate intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) lacking classical B-, T-, and natural killer (NK)-cell lineage markers (Lin(-)IELs) in the duodenum. In ∼50% of patients with RCDII, these Lin(-)IELs develop into a lymphoma for which no effective treatment is available. Current evidence indicates that the survival and expansion of these malignant Lin(-)IELs is driven by epithelial cell-derived IL-15. Like CD, RCDII is strongly associated with HLA-DQ2, suggesting the involvement of HLA-DQ2-restricted gluten-specific CD4(+) T cells. We now show that gluten-specific CD4(+) T cells isolated from CD duodenal biopsy specimens produce cytokines able to trigger proliferation of malignant Lin(-)IEL lines as powerfully as IL-15. Furthermore, we identify TNF, IL-2, and IL-21 as CD4(+) T-cell cytokines that synergistically mediate this effect. Like IL-15, these cytokines were found to increase the phosphorylation of STAT5 and Akt and transcription of antiapoptotic mediator bcl-xL Several small-molecule inhibitors targeting the JAK/STAT pathway blocked proliferation elicited by IL-2 and IL-15, but only an inhibitor targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway blocked proliferation induced by IL-15 as well as the CD4(+) T-cell cytokines. Confirming and extending these findings, TNF, IL-2, and IL-21 also synergistically triggered the proliferation of freshly isolated Lin(-)IELs and CD3(-)CD56(+) IELs (NK-IELs) from RCDII as well as non-RCDII duodenal biopsy specimens. These data provide evidence implicating CD4(+) T-cell cytokines in the pathogenesis of RCDII. More broadly, they suggest that adaptive immune responses can contribute to innate IEL activation during mucosal inflammation.	NA	0
28049847	Gpr132 sensing of lactate mediates tumor-macrophage interplay to promote breast cancer metastasis.	Macrophages are prominent immune cells in the tumor microenvironment that exert potent effects on cancer metastasis. However, the signals and receivers for the tumor-macrophage communication remain enigmatic. Here, we show that G protein-coupled receptor 132 (Gpr132) functions as a key macrophage sensor of the rising lactate in the acidic tumor milieu to mediate the reciprocal interaction between cancer cells and macrophages during breast cancer metastasis. Lactate activates macrophage Gpr132 to promote the alternatively activated macrophage (M2)-like phenotype, which, in turn, facilitates cancer cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. Consequently, Gpr132 deletion reduces M2 macrophages and impedes breast cancer lung metastasis in mice. Clinically, Gpr132 expression positively correlates with M2 macrophages, metastasis, and poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. These findings uncover the lactate-Gpr132 axis as a driver of breast cancer metastasis by stimulating tumor-macrophage interplay, and reveal potential new therapeutic targets for breast cancer treatment.	prognostic	2
28049826	MYH9 binds to lncRNA gene PTCSC2 and regulates FOXE1 in the 9q22 thyroid cancer risk locus.	A locus on chromosome 9q22 harbors a SNP (rs965513) firmly associated with risk of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The locus also comprises the forkhead box E1 (FOXE1) gene, which is implicated in thyroid development, and a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) gene, papillary thyroid cancer susceptibility candidate 2 (PTCSC2). How these might interact is not known. Here we report that PTCSC2 binds myosin-9 (MYH9). In a bidirectional promoter shared by FOXE1 and PTCSC2, MYH9 inhibits the promoter activity in both directions. This inhibition can be reversed by PTCSC2, which acts as a suppressor. RNA knockdown of FOXE1 in primary thyroid cells profoundly interferes with the p53 pathway. We propose that the interaction between the lncRNA, its binding protein MYH9, and the coding gene FOXE1 underlies the predisposition to PTC triggered by rs965513.	NA	0
28052327	Tissue disruption increases stochastic gene expression thus producing tumours: Cancer initiation without driver mutation.	Cancer research produced many paradoxical results in recent years. The reductionist approach now shows its limits. Considering the origin of the disease at the tissue level and increased stochastic gene expression (SGE) as a driving force, while admitting a role for genetic alterations in cancer progression, might solve these contradictions. Undifferentiated cells are characterized by open and accessible chromatin generating global and highly SGE (high expression noise) which is a hallmark of pluripotency, while differentiation is associated with progressive chromatin closing and decreased noise. Cell-cell interactions stabilize phenotypes and homogenize expression patterns from cell-to-cell during development and differentiation, while disruption of these interactions is responsible for increased expression noise that might be the causal event in cancer by producing phenotypic plasticity. It would produce cancer stem cells defined as cells exhibiting increased SGE that are no more controlled by the microenvironment. Following tissue disruption, differentiation and/or quiescence would no longer be maintained because of SGE. Genetic and epigenetic instabilities would necessary appear, increasing the risk of malignant transformation. The classical perspective is reversed: disruption of the tissue equilibrium is the initiator event, and genetic alterations are tumor &quot;promoters&quot;. The major role of genetic modifications in cancer progression is not denied, but microenvironmental and epigenetic alterations would precede the emergence of cancer. If mutagenic exposure, cancer predisposition, or spontaneous mutations have already produced genetic alterations, precancerous cells would become more aggressive more rapidly, increasing the probability that a tumor forms, but only if the correct microenvironment is not maintained.

28049525	Nutrition therapy with high intensity interval training to improve prostate cancer-related fatigue in men on androgen deprivation therapy: a study protocol.	BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue is one of the most prevalent, prolonged and distressing side effects of prostate cancer treatment with androgen deprivation therapy. Preliminary evidence suggests natural therapies such as nutrition therapy and structured exercise prescription can reduce symptoms of cancer-related fatigue. Men appear to change their habitual dietary patterns after prostate cancer diagnosis, yet prostate-specific dietary guidelines provide limited support for managing adverse side effects of treatment. The exercise literature has shown high intensity interval training can improve various aspects of health that are typically impaired with androgen deprivation therapy; however exercise at this intensity is yet to be conducted in men with prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of nutrition therapy beyond the current healthy eating guidelines with high intensity interval training for managing cancer-related fatigue in men with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy.DESIGN: This is a two-arm randomized control trial of 116 men with prostate cancer and survivors treated with androgen deprivation therapy. Participants will be randomized to either the intervention group i.e. nutrition therapy and high intensity interval training, or usual care. The intervention group will receive 20 weeks of individualized nutrition therapy from an Accredited Practising Dietitian, and high intensity interval training (from weeks 12-20 of the intervention) from an Accredited Exercise Physiologist. The usual care group will maintain their standard treatment regimen over the 20 weeks. Both groups will undertake primary and secondary outcome testing at baseline, week 8, 12, and 20; testing includes questionnaires of fatigue and quality of life, objective measures of body composition, muscular strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, biomarkers for disease progression, as well as dietary analysis. The primary outcomes for this trial are measures of fatigue and quality of life.DISCUSSION: This study is the first of its kind to determine the efficacy of nutrition therapy above the healthy eating guidelines and high intensity interval training for alleviating prostate-cancer related fatigue. If successful, nutrition therapy and high intensity interval training may be proposed as an effective therapy for managing cancer-related fatigue and improving quality of life in men during and after prostate cancer treatment.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12615000512527 .

28049506	Novel derivative of aminobenzenesulfonamide (3c) induces apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells through ROS generation and inhibits cell migration.	BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3(rd) most common type of cancer worldwide. New anti-cancer agents are needed for treating late stage colorectal cancer as most of the deaths occur due to cancer metastasis. A recently developed compound, 3c has shown to have potent antitumor effect; however the mechanism underlying the antitumor effect remains unknown.METHODS: 3c-induced inhibition of proliferation was measured in the absence and presence NAC using MTT in HT-29 and SW620 cells and xCELLigence RTCA DP instrument. 3c-induced apoptotic studies were performed using flow cytometry. 3c-induced redox alterations were measured by ROS production using fluorescence plate reader and flow cytometry and mitochondrial membrane potential by flow cytometry; NADPH and GSH levels were determined by colorimetric assays. Bcl2 family protein expression and cytochrome c release and PARP activation was done by western blotting. Caspase activation was measured by ELISA. Cell migration assay was done using the real time xCELLigence RTCA DP system in SW620 cells and wound healing assay in HT-29.RESULTS: Many anticancer therapeutics exert their effects by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we demonstrate that 3c-induced inhibition of cell proliferation is reversed by the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, suggesting that 3c acts via increased production of ROS in HT-29 cells. This was confirmed by the direct measurement of ROS in 3c-treated colorectal cancer cells. Additionally, treatment with 3c resulted in decreased NADPH and glutathione levels in HT-29 cells. Further, investigation of the apoptotic pathway showed increased release of cytochrome c resulting in the activation of caspase-9, which in turn activated caspase-3 and -6. 3c also (i) increased p53 and Bax expression, (ii) decreased Bcl2 and BclxL expression and (iii) induced PARP cleavage in human colorectal cancer cells. Confirming our observations, NAC significantly inhibited induction of apoptosis, ROS production, cytochrome c release and PARP cleavage. The results further demonstrate that 3c inhibits cell migration by modulating EMT markers and inhibiting TGFβ-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 and Samd3.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings thus demonstrate that 3c disrupts redox balance in colorectal cancer cells and support the notion that this agent may be effective for the treatment of colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: In head and neck cancer little is known about the kinetics of osteopontin (OPN) expression after tumor resection. In this study we evaluated the time course of OPN plasma levels before and after surgery.METHODS: Between 2011 and 2013 41 consecutive head and neck cancer patients were enrolled in a prospective study (group A). At different time points plasma samples were collected: T0) before, T1) 1 day, T2) 1 week and T3) 4 weeks after surgery. Osteopontin and TGFβ1 plasma concentrations were measured with a commercial ELISA system. Data were compared to 131 head and neck cancer patients treated with primary (n = 42) or postoperative radiotherapy (n = 89; group B1 and B2).RESULTS: A significant OPN increase was seen as early as 1 day after surgery (T0 to T1, p &lt; 0.01). OPN levels decreased to base line 3-4 weeks after surgery. OPN values were correlated with postoperative TGFβ1 expression suggesting a relation to wound healing. Survival analysis showed a significant benefit for patients with lower OPN levels both in the primary and postoperative radiotherapy group (B1: 33 vs 11.5 months, p = 0.017, B2: median not reached vs 33.4, p = 0.031). TGFβ1 was also of prognostic significance in group B1 (33.0 vs 10.7 months, p = 0.003).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with head and neck cancer showed an increase in osteopontin plasma levels directly after surgery. Four weeks later OPN concentration decreased to pre-surgery levels. This long lasting increase was presumably associated to wound healing. Both pretherapeutic osteopontin and TGFβ1 had prognostic impact.	NA	0
28049453	Which symptoms are linked to a delayed presentation among melanoma patients? A retrospective study.	BACKGROUND: The incidence of melanoma is rising. Early detection is associated with a more favourable outcome. The factors that influence the timing of a patient's presentation for medical assessment are not fully understood. The aims of the study were to measure the nature and duration of melanoma symptoms in a group of patients diagnosed with melanoma within the preceding 18 months and to identify the symptoms and barriers associated with a delay in presentation.METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to a random sample of 200 of the 963 melanoma patients who had participated in the Cancer Patient Experience Survey 2010 and were known to be alive 1 year later. Data were collected on symptoms, duration of symptoms prior to presentation and the reasons for not attending a doctor sooner.RESULTS: A total of 159 patients responded to the questionnaire; 74 (47%) were men; mean age was 62 (range 24-90) years. Of the 149 patients who reported a symptom, 40 (27%) had a delayed presentation (i.e. &gt;3 months). A mole growing bigger was the most common symptom and reporting this symptom was significantly associated with a delayed presentation (odds ratio (OR) 2.04, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.14-5.08). Patients aged ≥65 years were less likely to report a barrier to presentation and were less likely to delay than those under 40, although this was of borderline statistical significance (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.08-1.00).CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that an enlarging mole is a significant symptom influencing the timing of presentation. Increasing public awareness of the signs of melanoma and of the importance of early presentation is desirable. Health professionals should take advantage of the opportunity to educate patients on such symptoms and signs where feasible. Further exploration of the barriers to presentation in younger people should be considered.	NA	0
28049452	Waiting time for cancer treatment and mental health among patients with newly diagnosed esophageal or gastric cancer: a nationwide cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Except for overall survival, whether or not waiting time for treatment could influences other domains of cancer patients' overall well-being is to a large extent unknown. Therefore, we performed this study to determine the effect of waiting time for cancer treatment on the mental health of patients with esophageal or gastric cancer.METHODS: Based on the Swedish National Quality Register for Esophageal and Gastric Cancers (NREV), we followed 7,080 patients diagnosed 2006-2012 from the time of treatment decision. Waiting time for treatment was defined as the interval between diagnosis and treatment decision, and was classified into quartiles. Mental disorders were identified by either clinical diagnosis through hospital visit or prescription of psychiatric medications. For patients without any mental disorder before treatment, the association between waiting time and subsequent onset of mental disorders was assessed by hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI), derived from multivariable-adjusted Cox model. For patients with a preexisting mental disorder, we compared the rate of psychiatric care by different waiting times, allowing for repeated events.RESULTS: Among 4,120 patients without any preexisting mental disorder, lower risk of new onset mental disorders was noted for patients with longer waiting times, i.e. 18-29 days (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.74-1.00) and 30-60 days (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.67-0.93) as compared with 9-17 days. Among 2,312 patients with preexisting mental disorders, longer waiting time was associated with more frequent psychiatric hospital care during the first year after treatment (37.5% higher rate per quartile increase in waiting time; p for trend = 0.0002). However, no such association was observed beyond one year nor for the prescription of psychiatric medications.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that waiting time to treatment for esophageal or gastric cancer may have different mental health consequences for patients depending on their past psychiatric vulnerabilities. Our study sheds further light on the complexity of waiting time management, and calls for a comprehensive strategy that takes into account different domains of patient well-being in addition to the overall survival.

28050011	Consensus molecular subtypes and the evolution of precision medicine in colorectal cancer.	Critical driver genomic events in colorectal cancer have been shown to affect the response to targeted agents that were initially developed under the 'one gene, one drug' paradigm of precision medicine. Our current knowledge of the complexity of the cancer genome, clonal evolution patterns under treatment pressure and pharmacodynamic effects of target inhibition support the transition from a one gene, one drug approach to a 'multi-gene, multi-drug' model when making therapeutic decisions. Better characterization of the transcriptomic subtypes of colorectal cancer, encompassing tumour, stromal and immune components, has revealed convergent pathway dependencies that mandate a 'multi-molecular' perspective for the development of therapies to treat this disease.

28049525	Nutrition therapy with high intensity interval training to improve prostate cancer-related fatigue in men on androgen deprivation therapy: a study protocol.	BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue is one of the most prevalent, prolonged and distressing side effects of prostate cancer treatment with androgen deprivation therapy. Preliminary evidence suggests natural therapies such as nutrition therapy and structured exercise prescription can reduce symptoms of cancer-related fatigue. Men appear to change their habitual dietary patterns after prostate cancer diagnosis, yet prostate-specific dietary guidelines provide limited support for managing adverse side effects of treatment. The exercise literature has shown high intensity interval training can improve various aspects of health that are typically impaired with androgen deprivation therapy; however exercise at this intensity is yet to be conducted in men with prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of nutrition therapy beyond the current healthy eating guidelines with high intensity interval training for managing cancer-related fatigue in men with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy.DESIGN: This is a two-arm randomized control trial of 116 men with prostate cancer and survivors treated with androgen deprivation therapy. Participants will be randomized to either the intervention group i.e. nutrition therapy and high intensity interval training, or usual care. The intervention group will receive 20 weeks of individualized nutrition therapy from an Accredited Practising Dietitian, and high intensity interval training (from weeks 12-20 of the intervention) from an Accredited Exercise Physiologist. The usual care group will maintain their standard treatment regimen over the 20 weeks. Both groups will undertake primary and secondary outcome testing at baseline, week 8, 12, and 20; testing includes questionnaires of fatigue and quality of life, objective measures of body composition, muscular strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, biomarkers for disease progression, as well as dietary analysis. The primary outcomes for this trial are measures of fatigue and quality of life.DISCUSSION: This study is the first of its kind to determine the efficacy of nutrition therapy above the healthy eating guidelines and high intensity interval training for alleviating prostate-cancer related fatigue. If successful, nutrition therapy and high intensity interval training may be proposed as an effective therapy for managing cancer-related fatigue and improving quality of life in men during and after prostate cancer treatment.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12615000512527 .

28050764	Polymorphisms in apoptosis-related genes in cutaneous melanoma prognosis: sex disparity.	Cutaneous melanoma (CM) cells are resistant to apoptosis, and steroid hormones are involved in this process through regulation of TP53, MDM2, BAX, and BCL2 expression. We analyzed herein sex differences in outcomes of CM patients associated with TP53 c.215G&gt;C, MDM2 c.309T&gt;G, BAX c.-248G&gt;A, and BCL2 c.-717C&gt;A polymorphisms. DNA from 121 men and 116 women patients was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and enzymatic digestion assays. At 60 months of follow-up, shorter progression-free survival (PFS) was seen in males with MDM2 GG + BCL2 AA (20.0 vs. 62.6%, P = 0.0008) genotype. Men carriers of the genotype had poor PFS (HR 3.78, 95% CI 1.30-11.0) than others. For women, shorter PFS was associated with TP53 GC or CC (61.4 vs. 80.8%, P = 0.01) and TP53 GC or CC + MDM2 TG or GG (59.1 vs. 85.4%, P = 0.01) genotypes at the same time. Women carriers of the genotypes had poor PFS (HR 2.46, 95% CI 1.19-5.09; HR 9.49, 95% CI 1.14-78.50) than others, respectively. Our data present, for the first time, preliminary evidence that inherited abnormalities on TP53, MDM2 and BCL2 genes, enrolled in apoptosis pathways, have a pivotal role in differences of outcomes in women and men with CM.

28052301	C-Arm Cone Beam Computed Tomography Guidance for Radiofrequency Ablation in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of C-arm cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) combined with ultrasound for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by radiofrequency ablation (RFA).METHODS: Patients underwent RFA following transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or RFA alone under ultrasound or CBCT guidance combined with ultrasound-based techniques. They were divided into 2 groups based on the use (C group) and nonuse (NC group) of CBCT guidance. The technical success of RFA and local tumor progression after the first RFA session were evaluated by dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging methods. Between-group differences were assessed retrospectively.RESULTS: We enrolled 198 patients with 260 HCC nodules. The complete ablation rates were 63.0 and 89.4% in the NC and C groups, respectively. In log-rank testing, local tumor progression occurred significantly more often in the NC group when RFA was used without TACE, in males when des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin was ≥29 mAU/mL, and when the diameter of a nodule was ≥18 mm. On Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis, the NC group, RFA alone without TACE, and male gender were significant independent variables.CONCLUSION: TACE followed by RFA under CBCT and ultrasound guidance improves the reliability of ablation of target HCC nodules, reduces the need for additional treatment sessions, and prevents local tumor progression.

28052299	Characterization of Conversion Chemotherapy for Secondary Surgical Resection in Colorectal Cancer Patients with Lung Metastases.	OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials demonstrated that 6-37% of the patients with colorectal liver-limited metastases underwent surgical resection after first-line chemotherapy. However, limited information is available on the conversion of colorectal cancer patients with lung metastases to resection by systemic chemotherapy.METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 156 patients with unresectable colorectal cancer who received oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based first-line systemic chemotherapy with or without antibodies in our department between January 2007 and December 2015. The conversion rate to surgery and chemotherapeutic regimens and periods were analyzed with respect to the target organ.RESULTS: In addition to 4 patients who achieved complete response, 73 exhibited tumor shrinkage of any extent. Twenty patients underwent secondary surgery, all of whom received targeting antibodies. In 75 patients with liver metastases, 18 (24%) were converted to resection after chemotherapy for a median of 110 days. In contrast, 4 (7%) out of 56 patients with lung metastases underwent resection after chemotherapy for a median of 449 days. Conversion was an independent prognostic factor in patients with lung metastases.CONCLUSION: The conversion rate to resection was lower for colorectal cancer patients with lung metastasis by systemic chemotherapy, which required a longer duration than for those with liver metastases.

28052298	The Maze of Diagnosing Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis: Single-Center Experience of a Series of 6 Clinical Cases.	Clinical symptoms of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) are based on an excessive inflammatory response. Not only the diversity of the putative underlying etiologies of this rare syndrome but also the subsequent large variety of symptoms complicate the diagnosis of HLH in adult patients. However, early diagnosis and immediate treatment initiation are imperative for clinical outcome. In this article, we will review the diagnostic criteria of HLH and, in this context, discuss 6 cases, each of whom presented with a different clinical appearance causally associated with distinct malignant and nonmalignant diseases, exemplifying the spectrum of associations and manifestations of HLH.

28050866	MicroRNA-638 inhibits cell proliferation by targeting suppress PIM1 expression in human osteosarcoma.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a type of small noncoding RNAs that often play important roles in carcinogenesis, but the carcinogenic mechanism of miRNAs is still unclear. This study will investigate the functions and the mechanism of miR-638 in osteosarcoma (OS). The expression of miR-638 in OS and the DNA copy number of miR-638 were detected by real-time PCR. The effect of miR-638 on cell proliferation was measured by CCK8 assay. Different assays, including bioinformatics algorithms, luciferase report assay, and Western blotting, were used to identify the target gene proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1) of miR-638 in OS. The expression of PIM1 in clinical OS tissues was also validated by immunohistochemical assay. From this research, we found that miR-638 was downregulated in OS tissues compared with corresponding noncancerous tissues (NCTs), and the DNA copy number of miR-638 was lower in OS than in NCTs, which may induce the corresponding downregulation of miR-638 in OS. Ectopic expression of miR-638 inhibited OS cell growth in vitro. Subsequently, we identified that PIM1 is the downstream target gene of miR-638 in OS cells, and silencing PIM1 expression phenocopied the inhibitory effect of miR-638 on OS cell proliferation. Furthermore, we observed that PIM1 was overexpressed in OS tissues, and high expression of PIM1 in OS predicted poor overall survival. In summary, we revealed that miR-638 functions as a tumor suppressor through inhibiting PIM1 expression in OS.	prognostic	1
28052255	Personalized Proteome Profiles of Healthy and Tumor Human Colon Organoids Reveal Both Individual Diversity and Basic Features of Colorectal Cancer.	Diseases at the molecular level are complex and patient dependent, necessitating development of strategies that enable precision treatment to optimize clinical outcomes. Organoid technology has recently been shown to have the potential to recapitulate the in vivo characteristics of the original individual's tissue in a three-dimensional in vitro culture system. Here, we present a quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis and a comparative transcriptomic analysis of human colorectal tumor and healthy organoids derived, in parallel, from seven patients. Although gene and protein signatures can be derived to distinguish the tumor organoid population from healthy organoids, our data clearly reveal that each patient possesses a distinct organoid signature at the proteomic level. We demonstrate that a personalized patient-specific organoid proteome profile can be related to the diagnosis of a patient and with future development contribute to the generation of personalized therapies.

28052254	Pan-cancer Immunogenomic Analyses Reveal Genotype-Immunophenotype Relationships and Predictors of Response to Checkpoint Blockade.	The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed the genomic landscapes of human cancers. In parallel, immunotherapy is transforming the treatment of advanced cancers. Unfortunately, the majority of patients do not respond to immunotherapy, making the identification of predictive markers and the mechanisms of resistance an area of intense research. To increase our understanding of tumor-immune cell interactions, we characterized the intratumoral immune landscapes and the cancer antigenomes from 20 solid cancers and created The Cancer Immunome Atlas (https://tcia.at/). Cellular characterization of the immune infiltrates showed that tumor genotypes determine immunophenotypes and tumor escape mechanisms. Using machine learning, we identified determinants of tumor immunogenicity and developed a scoring scheme for the quantification termed immunophenoscore. The immunophenoscore was a superior predictor of response to anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies in two independent validation cohorts. Our findings and this resource may help inform cancer immunotherapy and facilitate the development of precision immuno-oncology.	NA	0
28052252	Biphasic Dependence of Glioma Survival and Cell Migration on CD44 Expression Level.	While several studies link the cell-surface marker CD44 to cancer progression, conflicting results show both positive and negative correlations with increased CD44 levels. Here, we demonstrate that the survival outcomes of genetically induced glioma-bearing mice and of high-grade human glioma patients are biphasically correlated with CD44 level, with the poorest outcomes occurring at intermediate levels. Furthermore, the high-CD44-expressing mesenchymal subtype exhibited a positive trend of survival with increased CD44 level. Mouse cell migration rates in ex vivo brain slice cultures were also biphasically associated with CD44 level, with maximal migration corresponding to minimal survival. Cell simulations suggest that cell-substrate adhesiveness is sufficient to explain this biphasic migration. More generally, these results highlight the potential importance of non-monotonic relationships between survival and biomarkers associated with cancer progression.	NA	2
28051067	VGLL4 targets a TCF4-TEAD4 complex to coregulate Wnt and Hippo signalling in colorectal cancer.	Concerted co-regulation of multiple signalling pathways is crucial for tissue homoeostasis and tumorigenesis. Here we report that VGLL4, a previously identified YAP antagonist, also functions as a regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signalling. The expression of VGLL4 is significantly downregulated in clinical colorectal carcinoma (CRC) specimens, positively associated with patient survival rate, and inversely correlated with the expression of Wnt target genes in CRCs. Knockdown of VGLL4 enhances proliferation and tumour formation of CRC cells. A designed peptide mimicking the function of VGLL4 effectively inhibits CRC progression in a de novo mouse model. Mechanistically, TEAD4 associates with TCF4 to form a complex and cobind target genes. VGLL4 targets this TEAD4-TCF4 complex to interfere the functional interplay between TEAD4 and TCF4, suppressing the transactivation of TCF4. Collectively, our study indicates that Wnt/β-catenin and Hippo-YAP signalling are directly linked at transcription factor-level, and VGLL4 can target a TEAD4-TCF4 complex to co-regulate both pathways.	prognostic	2
28050726	Preoperative Chemotherapy and Survival for Large Anorectal Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors: A National Analysis of 333 Cases.	PURPOSE: Anorectal gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are exceedingly rare, and management remains controversial in regard to local resection (LR) and preoperative chemotherapy.METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base was queried from 1998 to 2012 for cases of GIST resection in the rectum or anus. Patient demographics, type of surgery (LR vs. radical excision [RE]), short-term outcomes, and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Preoperative chemotherapy was recorded following the US FDA approval of imatinib in 2002.RESULTS: Overall, 333 patients with resection of anorectal GISTs were included. Mean age at presentation was 62.3 years (range 22-90), and median tumor size was 4.0 cm (interquartile range 2.2-7.0). Five-year OS for all patients was 77.6%. In a multivariable survival analysis, only age and tumor size &gt;5 cm (hazard ratio 2.48, 95% confidence interval 1.50-4.01; p = 0.004) were associated with increased mortality. One hundred and sixty-three (49.0%) patients underwent LR, compared with 158 (47.4%) who underwent RE. For tumors smaller than 5 cm, no difference in 5-year survival by surgical approach was observed (LR 82.3% vs. RE 82.6%; p = 0.71). Fifty-nine patients (17.7%) received preoperative chemotherapy; for patients undergoing RE with tumors &gt;5 cm, there was decreased mortality in the group who received preoperative chemotherapy (5-year OS with chemotherapy 79.2% vs. no chemotherapy 51.2%; p = 0.03).CONCLUSIONS: Size is the most important determinant in survival following resection. Local excision is common, with resection split between LR and RE. For smaller tumors, LR may be adequate therapy. Preoperative chemotherapy may result in improved survival for large tumors treated with radical resection, but the data are imperfect.	NA	0

28049632	Paleogenetic study of ancient DNA suggestive of X-Linked acrogigantism.	Extract: Dear Editor, Pituitary gigantism is caused by chronic growth hormone (GH) hypersecretion by a pituitary lesion before epiphyseal fusion. Genetic causes have been identified in nearly 50% of patients with pituitary gigantism, with germline mutations in the AIP gene being the most frequent cause (Rostomyan et al. 2015). Recently, a new form of pituitary gigantism, X-linked acrogigantism (X-LAG), was described (Trivellin et al. 2014). X-LAG is due to chromosome Xq26.3 duplication and GPR101 is the disease-associated gene (Trivellin et al. 2014; Iacovazzo et al. 2016). X-LAG is characterized by of mixed GH/prolactin-secreting pituitary macroadenomas and/or hyperplasia in early childhood (Beckers et al. 2015). X-LAG typically occurs sporadically in females, but somatic mosaicism also occurs in males; familial mother-to-son transmission of the Xq26.3 duplication has been reported in three familial isolated pituitary adenoma families (Trivellin et al. 2014; Daly et al. 2016; Gordon et al. 2016; Iacovazzo et al. 2016). The clinical presentation of X-LAG syndrome differs from other genetic forms of pituitary gigantism (Rostomyan et al. 2015) and many well-known historical cases of gigantism share the clinical characteristics of X-LAG syndrome (Beckers et al. 2015; Rostomyan et al. 2015). If untreated during childhood X-LAG leads to established extreme gigantism (&gt;1.9 meters) before puberty (Daly et al. 2016) ...	NA	0
28051182	Nesting of colon and ovarian cancer cells in the endothelial niche is associated with alterations in glycan and lipid metabolism.	The metabolic phenotype of a cancer cell is determined by its genetic makeup and microenvironment, which dynamically modulates the tumor landscape. The endothelial cells provide both a promoting and protective microenvironment - a niche for cancer cells. Although metabolic alterations associated with cancer and its progression have been fairly defined, there is a significant gap in our understanding of cancer metabolism in context of its microenvironment. We deployed an in vitro co-culture system based on direct contact of cancer cells with endothelial cells (E4(+)EC), mimicking the tumor microenvironment. Metabolism of colon (HTC15 and HTC116) and ovarian (OVCAR3 and SKOV3) cancer cell lines was profiled with non-targeted metabolic approaches at different time points in the first 48 hours after co-culture was established. We found significant, coherent and non-cell line specific changes in fatty acids, glycerophospholipids and carbohydrates over time, induced by endothelial cell contact. The metabolic patterns pinpoint alterations in hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, glycosylation and lipid metabolism as crucial for cancer - endothelial cells interaction. We demonstrated that &quot;Warburg effect&quot; is not modulated in the initial stage of nesting of cancer cell in the endothelial niche. Our study provides novel insight into cancer cell metabolism in the context of the endothelial microenvironment.	NA	0

28051153	The metastasis suppressor RARRES3 as an endogenous inhibitor of the immunoproteasome expression in breast cancer cells.	In breast cancer metastasis, the dynamic continuum involving pro- and anti-inflammatory regulators can become compromised. Over 600 genes have been implicated in metastasis to bone, lung or brain but how these genes might contribute to perturbation of immune function is poorly understood. To gain insight, we adopted a gene co-expression network approach that draws on the functional parallels between naturally occurring bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and cancer stem cells (CSCs). Our network analyses indicate a key role for metastasis suppressor RARRES3, including potential to regulate the immunoproteasome (IP), a specialized proteasome induced under inflammatory conditions. Knockdown of RARRES3 in near-normal mammary epithelial and breast cancer cell lines increases overall transcript and protein levels of the IP subunits, but not of their constitutively expressed counterparts. RARRES3 mRNA expression is controlled by interferon regulatory factor IRF1, an inducer of the IP, and is sensitive to depletion of the retinoid-related receptor RORA that regulates various physiological processes including immunity through modulation of gene expression. Collectively, these findings identify a novel regulatory role for RARRES3 as an endogenous inhibitor of IP expression, and contribute to our evolving understanding of potential pathways underlying breast cancer driven immune modulation.

28051150	Prostate Cancer Mortality-To-Incidence Ratios Are Associated with Cancer Care Disparities in 35 Countries.	The variation in mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs) among countries reflects the clinical outcomes and the available interventions for colorectal cancer treatments. The association between MIR of prostate cancer and cancer care disparities among countries is an interesting issue that is rarely investigated. For the present study, cancer incidence and mortality rates were obtained from the GLOBOCAN 2012 database. The rankings and total expenditures on health of various countries were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO). The association between variables was analyzed by linear regression analyses. In this study, we estimated the role of MIRs from 35 countries that had a prostate cancer incidence greater than 5,000 cases per year. As expected, high prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates were observed in more developed regions, such as Europe and the Americas. However, the MIRs were 2.5 times higher in the less developed regions. Regarding the association between MIR and cancer care disparities, countries with good WHO ranking and high total expenditures on health/gross domestic product (GDP) were significant correlated with low MIR. The MIR variation for prostate cancer correlates with cancer care disparities among countries further support the role of cancer care disparities in clinical outcome.	NA	0
28051122	KRAS-mutation incidence and prognostic value are metastatic site-specific in lung adenocarcinoma: poor prognosis in patients with KRAS mutation and bone metastasis.	Current guidelines lack comprehensive information on the metastatic site-specific role of KRAS mutation in lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). We investigated the effect of KRAS mutation on overall survival (OS) in this setting. In our retrospective study, 500 consecutive Caucasian metastatic LADC patients with known KRAS mutational status were analyzed after excluding 32 patients with EGFR mutations. KRAS mutation incidence was 28.6%. The most frequent metastatic sites were lung (45.6%), bone (26.2%), adrenal gland (17.4%), brain (16.8%), pleura (15.6%) and liver (11%). Patients with intrapulmonary metastasis had significantly increased KRAS mutation frequency compared to those with extrapulmonary metastases (35% vs 26.5%, p = 0.0125). In contrast, pleural dissemination and liver involvement were associated with significantly decreased KRAS mutation incidence (vs all other metastatic sites; 17% (p &lt; 0.001) and 16% (p = 0.02) vs 33%, respectively). Strikingly, we found a significant prognostic effect of KRAS status only in the bone metastatic subcohort (KRAS-wild-type vs KRAS-mutant; median OS 9.7 v 3.7 months; HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.79; p  = 0.003). Our study suggests that KRAS mutation frequency in LADC patients shows a metastatic site dependent variation and, moreover, that the presence of KRAS mutation is associated with significantly worse outcome in bone metastatic cases.

28051113	A comprehensive custom panel design for routine hereditary cancer testing: preserving control, improving diagnostics and revealing a complex variation landscape.	We wanted to implement an NGS strategy to globally analyze hereditary cancer with diagnostic quality while retaining the same degree of understanding and control we had in pre-NGS strategies. To do this, we developed the I2HCP panel, a custom bait library covering 122 hereditary cancer genes. We improved bait design, tested different NGS platforms and created a clinically driven custom data analysis pipeline. The I2HCP panel was developed using a training set of hereditary colorectal cancer, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and neurofibromatosis patients and reached an accuracy, analytical sensitivity and specificity greater than 99%, which was maintained in a validation set. I2HCP changed our diagnostic approach, involving clinicians and a genetic diagnostics team from panel design to reporting. The new strategy improved diagnostic sensitivity, solved uncertain clinical diagnoses and identified mutations in new genes. We assessed the genetic variation in the complete set of hereditary cancer genes, revealing a complex variation landscape that coexists with the disease-causing mutation. We developed, validated and implemented a custom NGS-based strategy for hereditary cancer diagnostics that improved our previous workflows. Additionally, the existence of a rich genetic variation in hereditary cancer genes favors the use of this panel to investigate their role in cancer risk.	NA	2
28051104	Sequence specific sorting of DNA molecules with FACS using 3dPCR.	Genetic heterogeneity is an important feature of many biological systems, but introduces technical challenges to their characterization. Even with the best modern instruments, only a small fraction of DNA molecules present in a sample can be read, and they are recovered in the form of short, hundred-base reads. In this paper, we introduce 3dPCR, a method to sort DNA molecules with sequence specificity. 3dPCR allows heterogeneous populations of DNA to be sorted to recover long targets for deep sequencing. It is valuable whenever a target sequence is rare in a mixed population, such as for characterizing mutations in heterogeneous cancer cell populations or identifying cells containing a specific genetic sequence or infected with a target virus.

28051100	Protein serine/threonine phosphatase PPEF-1 suppresses genotoxic stress response via dephosphorylation of PDCD5.	Programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) is believed to play a crucial role in p53 activation; however, the underlying mechanism of how PDCD5 function is regulated during apoptosis remains obscure. Here, we report that the serine/threonine phosphatase PPEF-1 interacts with and dephosphorylates PDCD5 at Ser-119, which leads to PDCD5 destabilization. Overexpression of wild-type PPEF-1, but not inactive PPEF-1(D172N), efficiently suppressed CK2α-mediated stabilization of PDCD5 and p53-mediated apoptosis in response to etoposide (ET). Conversely, PPEF-1 knockdown further enhanced genotoxic stress responses. Notably, PPEF-1 suppressed p53-mediated genotoxic stress response via negative regulation of PDCD5. We also determined that overexpression of wild-type PPEF-1, but not inactive PPEF-1(D172N), significantly increased tumorigenic growth and chemoresistance of A549 human lung carcinoma cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that PPEF-1 plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis of lung cancer cells by reducing PDCD5-mediated genotoxic stress responses.	NA	0
28050010	Benchmarking of Whole Exome Sequencing and Ad Hoc Designed Panels for Genetic Testing of Hereditary Cancer.	Next generation sequencing panels have been developed for hereditary cancer, although there is some debate about their cost-effectiveness compared to exome sequencing. The performance of two panels is compared to exome sequencing. Twenty-four patients were selected: ten with identified mutations (control set) and fourteen suspicious of hereditary cancer but with no mutation (discovery set). TruSight Cancer (94 genes) and a custom panel (122 genes) were assessed alongside exome sequencing. Eighty-three genes were targeted by the two panels and exome sequencing. More than 99% of bases had a read depth of over 30x in the panels, whereas exome sequencing covered 94%. Variant calling with standard settings identified the 10 mutations in the control set, with the exception of MSH6 c.255dupC using TruSight Cancer. In the discovery set, 240 unique non-silent coding and canonic splice-site variants were identified in the panel genes, 7 of them putatively pathogenic (in ATM, BARD1, CHEK2, ERCC3, FANCL, FANCM, MSH2). The three approaches identified a similar number of variants in the shared genes. Exomes were more expensive than panels but provided additional data. In terms of cost and depth, panels are a suitable option for genetic diagnostics, although exomes also identify variants in non-targeted genes.	NA	0
28052520	IKAROS expression in distinct bone marrow cell populations as a candidate biomarker for outcome with lenalidomide-dexamethasone therapy in multiple myeloma.	Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) are a cornerstone in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), but specific markers to predict outcome are still missing. Recent work pointed to a prognostic role for IMiD target genes (e.g. CRBN). Moreover, indirect activity of IMiDs on immune cells correlated with outcome, raising the possibility that cell populations in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment could serve as biomarkers. We therefore analysed gene expression levels of six IMiD target genes in whole BM samples of 44 myeloma patients treated with lenalidomide-dexamethasone. Expression of CRBN (R=0.30, P=0.05), IKZF1 (R=0.31, P=0.04), IRF4 (R=0.38, P=0.01), MCT-1 (R=0.30, P=0.05) and CD147 (R=0.38, P=0.01), but not IKZF3 (R=-0.15, P=0.34), was significantly associated with response. Interestingly, IKZF1 expression was elevated in BM environmental cells and thus selected for further investigation by multicolour flow cytometry. High IKAROS protein levels in total BM mononuclear cells (median OS 83.4 vs 32.2 months, P=0.02), CD19(+) B cells (median OS 71.1 vs 32.2 months, P=0.05), CD3(+) CD8(+) T cells (median OS 83.4 vs 19.0 months, P=0.008) as well as monocytes (median OS 53.9 vs 18.0 months, P=0.009) were associated with superior overall survival (OS). In contrast, IKAROS protein expression in MM cells was not predictive for OS. Our data therefore corroborate the central role of immune cells for the clinical activity of IMiDs and built the groundwork for prospective analysis of IKAROS protein levels in distinct cell populations as a potential biomarker for IMiD based therapies.

28052408	Relapse Risk and Survival in Patients with FLT3 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Undergoing Stem Cell Transplantation.	In patients with AML with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations, the significance of minimal residual disease (MRD) detected by PCR before allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) on outcomes after transplant remains unclear. We identified 200 patients with FLT3-AML who underwent SCT at our institution. Disease status at transplant was: first or second complete remission (CR1/CR2, n=119), high-risk CR (third or subsequent CR, marrow hypoplasia, or incomplete count recovery) (CR-HR, n=31), and morphological evidence of active disease (AD, n=50). The median follow-up was 27 months, and the 2-year overall and progression-free survival were 43% and 41%, respectively. Relapse was highest in the AD group (85%) and the CR-HR FLT3 MRD positive group (72%), followed by CR-HR FLT3 MRD negative (58%), CR1/CR2 FLT3 MRD positive (39%), and lowest in the CR1/CR2 FLT3 MRD negative group (23%). On multivariate analysis, independent factors influencing the risk of relapse were detectable morphological disease and FLT3 MRD by PCR pre-transplant. Factors that did not influence the relapse risk included: age, graft type, graft source, type of FLT3 mutation, or conditioning intensity. Morphologic and molecular remission status at the time of transplant were key predictors of disease relapse and survival in patients with FLT3-AML. This article is protected by copyright.

28052371	Significance of recurrence of minimal residual disease detected by multi-parameter flow cytometry in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in morphological remission.	We sought to determine the significance of minimal residual disease (MRD) relapse in patients with ALL after achieving MRD negative status following induction and consolidation therapy. Between January 2003 and September 2014, 647 newly diagnosed patients were treated [HyperCVAD-based (n=531); Augmented BFM (n=116)]. 601 (93%) achieved complete remission (CR), and 546 (91%) became MRD negative. Fifty-five patients [HyperCVAD-based (n=49); Augmented BFM (n=6)] developed recurrence of MRD while still in morphological CR and are the subjects of this study. MRD was assessed by 6-color (4-color prior to 2009) multi-parameter flow cytometry (MFC) at CR and multiple time points thereafter. Their median age was 44 years (range, 18-72 years), median WBC at initial presentation was 7.3 K/uL (range, 0.6-303.8 K/uL) and median bone marrow blast percentage 88% (range, 26-98%). The median time to MRD relapse was 14 months (range 3-58 months). Forty-four (80%) patients subsequently developed morphological relapse after median of 3 months (range, &lt;1-33 months) from detection of MRD recurrence. Treatments received after MRD positivity and prior to morphological relapse: 16 continued maintenance chemotherapy; 15 received late intensification; 9 allogeneic stem cell transplant, 9 changed chemotherapy, 6 no further therapy. Only six remain alive and in CR1 and nine are alive after morphological relapse. MRD relapse detected by MFC at any time after achieving CR is associated with a high risk for morphological relapse. SCT can result in long-term remission in some patients. Prospective studies of long-term MRD assessments, together with less toxic treatment strategies to eradicate MRD, are warranted.

28052366	Impact of FAB Classification on Predicting Outcome in Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Not Otherwise Specified, Patients Undergoing Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in CR1: An Analysis of 1690 Patients from the Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT.	The French, American, and British (FAB) classification system for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is extensively used and is incorporated into the AML, not otherwise specified (NOS) category in the 2016 WHO edition of myeloid neoplasm classification. While recent data proposes that FAB classification does not provide additional prognostic information for patients for whom NPM1 status is available, it is unknown whether FAB still retains a current prognostic role in predicting outcome of AML patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Using the European Society of Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation registry we analyzed outcome of 1690 patients transplanted in CR1 to determine if FAB classification provides additional prognostic value. Multivariate analysis revealed that M6/M7 patients had decreased leukemia free survival (hazard ratio (HR) of 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.99; p=0.046) in addition to increased non relapse mortality (NRM) rates (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.06-3.01; p=0.028) compared to other FAB types. In the NPM1(wt) AML, NOS cohort, FAB M6/M7 was also associated with increased NRM (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.14-4.16; p=0.019). Finally, in FLT3-ITD(+) patients, multivariate analyses revealed that specific FAB types were tightly associated with adverse outcome. In conclusion, FAB classification may predict outcome following transplantation in AML, NOS patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	NA	2
28049629	Integrated Metabolomics and Proteomics Highlight Altered Nicotinamide- and Polyamine Pathways in Lung Adenocarcinoma.	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinoma being the most common histological type. Early perturbations in cellular metabolism are a hallmark of cancer, but the extent of these changes in early stage lung adenocarcinoma remains largely unknown. In the current study, an integrated metabolomics and proteomics approach was utilized to characterize the biochemical and molecular alterations between malignant and matched control tissue from 27 subjects diagnosed with early stage lung adenocarcinoma. Differential analysis identified 71 metabolites and 1102 proteins that delineated tumor from control tissue. Integrated results indicated four major metabolic changes in early stage adenocarcinoma: (1) increased glycosylation and glutaminolysis; (2) elevated Nrf2 activation; (3) increase in nicotinic and nicotinamide salvaging pathways; and (4) elevated polyamine biosynthesis linked to differential regulation of the SAM/nicotinamide methyl-donor pathway. Genomic data from publicly available databases were included to strengthen proteomic findings. Our findings provide insight into the biochemical and molecular biological reprogramming that may accompanies early stage lung tumorigenesis and highlight potential therapeutic targets.	NA	2
28052524	Cross-Species Analysis of the Canine and Human Bladder Cancer Transcriptome and Exome.	We investigated the correspondence between transcriptome and exome alterations in canine bladder cancer and the correspondence between these alterations and cancer-driving genes and transcriptional alterations in human bladder cancer. We profiled canine bladder tumors using mRNA-seq and exome-seq and used a comparative oncology approach to investigate: (i) the similarity of transcriptional alterations in bladder cancer vs. normal bladder, in humans and canines, at the levels of gene functions, pathways, and cytogenetic regions; and (ii) the extent to which genic mutations in canine bladder cancer are associated with known cancer mutations (from human) as well as alterations in transcript levels in the canine tumor. We found that the transcriptomes of canine and human bladder cancer are remarkably similar at the functional and pathway levels. We demonstrated that canine bladder cancer involves coordinated differential expression of genes within cytogenetic bands, and that these patterns are consistent with those seen in human bladder cancer. We found that mutation of a gene in canine bladder cancer is associated with a higher mutation recurrence frequency for the gene's human ortholog in human bladder cancer. Additionally, we found that (i) canine orthologs of human tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are more likely to be downregulated and more likely to be mutated in canine bladder cancer than orthologs of non-TSGs; and (ii) genes that are mutated in canine bladder cancer are more likely to be transcriptionally downregulated than non-mutated genes, in the tumor. Finally we report three novel mutations (FAM133B, RAB3GAP2, and ANKRD52) for canine bladder cancer. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	NA	0
28049532	Checkpoint kinase inhibitor AZD7762 strongly sensitises urothelial carcinoma cells to gemcitabine.	BACKGROUND: More effective chemotherapies are urgently needed for bladder cancer, a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We therefore explored the efficacy of the combination of gemcitabine and AZD7762, a checkpoint kinase 1/2 (CHK1/2) inhibitor, for bladder cancer.METHODS: Viability, clonogenicity, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were assessed in urothelial cancer cell lines and various non-malignant urothelial cells treated with gemcitabine and AZD7762. DNA damage was assessed by γH2A.X and 53-BP1 staining and checkpoint activation was followed by Western blotting. Pharmacological inhibition of CHK1 and CHK2 was compared to downregulation of either CHK1 or CHK2 using siRNAs.RESULTS: Combined use of gemcitabine and AZD7762 synergistically reduced urothelial carcinoma cell viability and colony formation relative to either single treatment. Non-malignant urothelial cells were substantially less sensitive to this drug combination. Gemcitabine plus AZD7762 inhibited cell cycle progression causing cell accumulation in S-phase. Moreover, the combination induced pronounced levels of apoptosis as indicated by an increase in the fraction of sub-G1 cells, in the levels of cleaved PARP, and in caspase 3/7 activity. Mechanistic investigations showed that AZD7762 treatment inhibited the repair of gemcitabine-induced double strand breaks by interference with CHK1, since siRNA-mediated depletion of CHK1 but not of CHK2 mimicked the effects of AZD7762.CONCLUSIONS: AZD7762 enhanced sensitivity of urothelial carcinoma cells to gemcitabine by inhibiting DNA repair and disturbing checkpoints. Combining gemcitabine with CHK1 inhibition holds promise for urothelial cancer therapy.	NA	2
28052414	MicroRNA-218 inhibits tumor growth and increases chemosensitivity to CDDP treatment by targeting BCAT1 in prostate cancer.	MicroRNAs have been reported to be associated with chemosensitivity of several types of cancers. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we explored miR-218 increased the chemosensitivity to cis-diaminedichloroplatinum treatment of prostate cancer. We found that the expression level of miR-218 was down-regulated in the human prostate cancer specimens. Moreover, overexpression of miR-218 inhibited cell viability, migration and invasion in PC3 and DU145 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the tumor suppressive role of miR-218 was mediated by negatively regulating branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1) protein expression. Importantly, overexpression of BCAT1 decreased the chemosensitivity to CDDP treatment of PC3 and DU145 cells. Our study is the first to identify the positive role of miR-218 in chemosensitivity, which will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer in the future.

28052407	P21-activated kinase 1 regulates resistance to BRAF inhibition in human cancer cells.	BRAF is a commonly mutated oncogene in various human malignancies and a target of a new class of anti-cancer agents, BRAF-inhibitors (BRAFi). The initial enthusiasm for these agents, based on the early successes in the management of metastatic melanoma, is now challenged by the mounting evidence of intrinsic BRAFi-insensitivity in many BRAF-mutated tumors, by the scarcity of complete responses, and by the inevitable emergence of drug resistance in initially responsive cases. These setbacks put an emphasis on discovering the means to increase the efficacy of BRAFi and to prevent or overcome BRAFi-resistance. We explored the role of p21-activated kinases (PAKs), in particular PAK1, in BRAFi response. BRAFi lowered the levels of active PAK1 in treated cells. An activated form of PAK1 conferred BRAFi-resistance on otherwise sensitive cells, while genetic or pharmacologic suppression of PAK1 had a sensitizing effect. While activation of AKT1 and RAC1 proto-oncogenes increased BRAFi-tolerance, the protective effect was negated in the presence of PAK inhibitors. Furthermore, combining otherwise ineffective doses of PAK- and BRAF-inhibitors synergistically affected intrinsically BRAFi-resistant cells. Considering the high incidence of PAK1 activation in cancers, our findings suggests PAK inhibition as a strategy to augment BRAFi therapy and overcome some of the well-known resistance mechanisms.

28052399	Molecular trail for the anticancer behavior of a novel copper carbohydrazone complex in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer.	Novel chelated metal complexes were synthesized from carbohydrazones and thiocarbohydrazones using metal-based drug designing platforms and their combination effect with Pb, a naphthaquinone were analyzed for anticancer activity in breast cancer cell lines. A panel of BRCA1 wild type and mutated breast cancer cells: MCF-7 (BRCA1(+) / ER(+) ), MDA-MB-231 (BRCA1(+) / ERα(-) ), HCC-1937 (BRCA1(-) / ERα(-) ), HCC1937/wt BRCA1, MX1 (BRCA1(-) / ERα(-) ) and MDA-MB-436 (BRCA1(-) / ERα(-) ) were screened for anti-cancer activity. Cu2 (HL)(HSO4 ) ·  H2 O]SO4  ·  6 H2 O (CS2) is the most potent anticancer agent among the copper carbohydrazone and thiocarbohydrazone complexes analyzed in this study. It can be suggested that the presence of sulphate, as pharmacologically active centre, can induce cytotoxicity more effectively when compared to chlorine, bromine, perchlorate and methanol. This is the first report demonstrating that CS2 can bind to DNA by hindering BamH1 activity and could induce DNA double strand breaks as evidenced by γ-H2AX expression. In addition to this, CS2 could also act as a Topo II inhibitor at a much lower concentration than etoposide and induce apoptosis, making it a potent anticancer agent. In combination with Pb, a potent ROS inducer, CS2 could induce synergistic anti-cancer activity in HR/ BRCA1 defective breast cancer cells. This is the first study reporting the mechanism involved in the induction of apoptosis for a metal chelated copper carbohydrazone complex and its combination effects with Pb in HR defective, BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells.

28049550	GEC-ESTRO/ACROP recommendations for performing bladder-sparing treatment with brachytherapy for muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma.	The standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is a radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In selected cases a bladder sparing approach is possible, for example a limited surgical excision combined with external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy. To perform brachytherapy flexible catheters have to be implanted in the bladder wall. The implantation is done either by the open retropubic approach or the endoscopic surgical approach. The largest experience for brachytherapy is with low-dose rate and pulsed-dose rate, although some short-term experience with high-dose rate is also reported. The main advantage for this technique is the conservation of bladder function, with comparable local control rates as for cystectomy series in selected cases. The GEC-ESTRO/ACROP (Groupe Européen de Curiethérapie-European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology / Advisory Committee on Radiation Oncology Practice) recommendations to perform bladder implantations and brachytherapy as a treatment option for MIBC are described.

28042511	Physcion induces apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma by modulating miR-370.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and aggressive malignancies. The current study is designed to explore the role of physcion, a major active ingredient in several traditional herbal medicinal plants, for the treatment of HCC. HCC cell lines, SMMC7721 and HepG2, were treated with physcion and its apoptosis-inducing effect was examined. Both in vitro and in vivo results from the present study demonstrated that physcion treatment resulted in apoptotic cell death in HCC cells via upregulation of miR-370. Furthermore, our findings showed that the physcion modulated the level of miR-370 through AMPK/Sp1/DNMT1 signaling. Taken together, these results showed that physcion exerts anti-tumor effect against HCC, which may be a potential agent for the adjunct chemotherapy.	NA	0
28042510	Molecular characterization of paediatric glioneuronal tumours with neuropil-like islands: a genome-wide copy number analysis.	Paediatric glioneuronal tumour with neuropil-like islands (GTNI) is a rare neoplasm of neuronal differentiation and diffusely infiltrating astroglial and oligodendrocyte-like components. The 2007 World Health Organization classification of central nervous system tumours considered it as a pattern variation of anaplastic astrocytoma. There are few data on paediatric GTNI probably both for their rarity and variable clinical aggressiveness. We studied by SNP/CGH array four tumour samples of GTNI from two males and two females (one new-born and three children aged from 4 to 8 years), in order to identify any possible common genomic alteration. All patients received chemo- and radiotherapy after their surgical treatment. No genomic instability nor recurrent alterations have been demonstrated in two of our GTNI cases. In the remaining two, we detected a mosaic trisomy 8 (15-20%) in one case, and an amplification at 5q14.1 involving DMGDH (partially), BHMT2 and BHMT genes, with the distal breakpoint falling at 23 Kbp from the 5'UTR of JMY, a p53 cofactor. Although the smallness of the sample impairs any clinical-histological correlation, GTNI appear different at the molecular level, with genomic imbalances playing a possible role in at least part of them. Our work gives an important contribution in knowledge and classification of this family of tumours.	NA	0
28042509	Ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (USP11) functions as a tumor suppressor through deubiquitinating and stabilizing VGLL4 protein.	VGLL4 is a transcriptional repressor that interacts with transcription factors TEADs and inhibits YAP-induced overgrowth and tumorigenesis. VGLL4 protein was dramatically reduced in various types of human cancers. But how VGLL4 protein is post-transcriptional regulated is poorly understood. In this study, we identify deubiquitinating enzyme USP11 as a novel VGLL4 interactor. We reveal that the USP domain of USP11 and the N-terminal region of VGLL4 are required for mutual binding. USP11 controls VGLL4 protein stability by promoting its deubiquitination. Furthermore, our results show that knockdown of USP11 promotes cell growth, migration, and invasion in a YAP-dependent manner. Together, our results suggest that USP11 may exert its tumor suppressor role by modulating VGLL4/YAP-TEADs regulatory loop.	NA	0
28042508	Usefulness of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for predicting treatment response to vinorelbine-cisplatin with or without recombinant human endostatin in bone metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer.	Metastatic bone disease is a frequent complication of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and causes skeletal-related events, which result in a poor prognosis. Currently, no standard method has been developed to precisely assess the therapeutic response of bone metastases (BM) and the early efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy, which does not conform to the concept of precision medicine. This study aimed to investigate the usefulness of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for precise evaluation of the response to chemotherapy with anti-angiogenic agents in NSCLC patients with BM. Patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group (vinorelbine + cisplatin [NP] + recombinant human endostatin [rh-endostatin]) or a control group (NP + placebo). All patients were evaluated before treatment and after 2 cycles of treatment using DCE-MRI quantitative analysis technology for BM lesions and chest computed tomography (CT). Correlations between changes in the DCE-MRI quantitative parameters and treatment effect were analyzed. We enrolled 33 patients, of whom 28 were evaluable (20 in the treatment group and 8 in the control group). The results suggested a higher objective response rate (30% vs. 0%), better overall survival (21.44 ± 17.28 months vs. 7.71 ± 4.68 months), and a greater decrease in the transport constant (Ktrans) value (60% vs. 4.4%) in the treatment group than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The Ktrans values in the &quot;partial remission plus stable disease (PR + SD)&quot; group were significantly lower after treatment (P &lt; 0.05). Patients with a decrease of &gt; 50% in the Ktrans value showed a significantly better overall survival than those with a decrease of ≤ 50% (13.2 vs. 9.8 months, P &lt; 0.05). Ktrans as a DEC-MRI quantitative parameter could be used for the precise evaluation of BM lesions after anti-angiogenic therapy and as a predictor of survival. In addition, we reconfirmed the anti-angiogenic effect of rh-endostatin in NSCLC patients with BM.	NA	0
28042507	MicroRNA-497 suppresses cell proliferation and induces apoptosis through targeting PBX3 in human multiple myeloma.	Aberrant expression of microRNA-497 (miRN-497) is implicated in development and progression of multiple types of cancers. However, the biological function and underlying mechanism of miR-497 in multiple myeloma (MM) remains unclear. Thus, we studied the potential biological roles of miR-497 in MM. The expression of miR-497 was examined in multiple myeloma and normal plasma cells by qRT-PCR. Biological functions of miR-497 were analyzed using cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, apoptosis and luciferase assays in vitro, as well as via tumorigenicity in vivo analysis. Here, we observed reduced expression of miR-497 in MM plasma samples and cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR-497 dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and clonogenicity, as well as induced cell arrest at G0/G1 stage and apoptosis in vitro. Mechanistic investigation assays showed that Pre-B-cellleukemia transcription factor 3 (PBX3) was a novel and direct downstream target of miR-497. Interestingly, overexpression of PBX3 partially reverted the effect of miR-497 in MM cells. In xenograft model, overexpression of miR-497 inhibited tumorigenicity by repressing PBX3. These findings collectively suggested that miR-497 functioned as tumor suppressor in MM by directly targeting PBX3, supporting its utility as a novel and potential therapeutic agent for MM therapy.

28042506	MicroRNA-613 suppresses proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma by targeting c-MET.	MicroRNA-613 (miR-613) has been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple cancers by negatively regulating gene expression at posttranscriptional level. However, the biological role of miR-613 in osteosarcoma (OS) remained unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the expression and biological roles of miR-613 in OS. We found that miR-613 was significantly downregulated in OS tissues and cell lines, and that decreased miR-613 expression was correlated negatively with advanced TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. Overexpression of miR-613 in OS cells significantly suppressed the proliferation and colony formation by regulating cell arrest at G0/G1 phase, and impaired the migration and invasive abilities of OS cells, followed by suppression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Bioinformatic and luciferase reporter analysis identified cellular-mesenchymal to epithelial transition factor (c-MET, also named as MET) as a direct target of miR-613. Overexpression of miR-613 significantly inhibited the c-MET expression and its downstream PI3k/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in OS cells. In OS clinical samples, there was a significant inverse correlation between miR-613 and c-MET mRNA expression. Rescue experiments showed that overexpression of c-MET partially prevented miR-613-induced suppression of OS cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion. In conclusion, we provide first evidence for the suppressive activity of miR-613 by repressing c-MET, suggesting that miR-613 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for OS.	NA	2
28042505	MicroRNA-187 exerts tumor-suppressing functions in osteosarcoma by targeting ZEB2.	MicroRNA-187 (miR-187) has been reported to be involved in the occurrence and development of several types of cancers; however, a role for miR-187 in osteosarcoma (OS) has not yet been reported. Here, miR-187 was found to be significantly downregulated in OS cell lines and tissue samples, and decreased miR-187 expression was shown to be correlated closely with the TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. miR-187 overexpression suppressed OS cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanically, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) was shown to serve as a direct target of miR-187 in OS cells and the overexpression of ZEB2 rescued the miR-187-induced suppression of proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in OS cells. In clinical OS specimens, ZEB2 expression levels were elevated and were inversely correlated with miR-187 expression. These results suggest that miR-187 functions as a tumor suppressor in OS, partially by targeting ZEB2, and that miR-187 can serve as a promising candidate for OS.	NA	2
28042504	Small molecular peptide-ScFv αvβ3 conjugates specifically inhibit lung cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo.	Integrin αvβ3 (ITG) is highly expressed in various cancers and is considered a major target for anti-angiogensis cancer therapy. The single chain fragment variable of which (ScFv αvβ3) has been reported to inhibit tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we conjugated cdGIGPQc which can exclusively bind to NSCLC cells according to our previous study synthesized by SPPS with ScFv αvβ3 expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) to develop a novel lung cancer specific targeted drug. Specific cell targeting of cdGIGPQc-ScFv was assessed in parallel with the single ScFv and a control nonspecific peptide-ScFv through immunofluorescence and flow cytometry while the αvβ3-binding property was examined by Western blot. Our results showed that cdGIGPQc-ScFv retained both the lung cancer-binding activity of cdGIGPQc and the antigen-recognizing ability of ScFv αvβ3 in vitro. CCK8 assays and in animal experiments suggested that cdGIGPQc-ScFv possessed a superior antitumor effect than ScFv and nonspecific peptide-ScFv both in vitro and vivo. Further immunohistochemical staining revealed that cdGIGPQc-ScFv retarded lung cancer growth through inhibiting tumor angiogensis and proliferation. Therefore, cdGIGPQc delivery of ScFv αvβ3 to lung cancer may be a hopeful new strategy for enhancing specific antitumor efficacy and cdGIGPQc-ScFv could be a potential drug for lung cancer targeted treatment.

28042503	Isobolographic analysis demonstrates additive effect of cisplatin and HDIs combined treatment augmenting their anti-cancer activity in lung cancer cell lines.	Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) are a new class of drugs which affect the activity of HDACs resulting in changed of acetylation in many proteins. HDIs can induce differentiation, cell growth arrest, apoptosis, inhibit proliferation and angiogenesis in cancer, whereas normal cells are comparatively resistant to the action of HDIs. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined effect of a well-known cytostatic agent-cisplatin (CDDP) and a histone deacetylase inhibitors-either suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, vorinostat) or valproic acid (VPA), on the proliferation of lung cancer cells, as well as induction of apoptosis and inhibition of the cell cycle progression. The anti-proliferative activity of VPA or SAHA used alone, or in combination with CDDP were determined by means of MTT test. The type of pharmacologic interactions between HDAC inhibitors and CDDP was assessed using isobolographic analysis. We observed additive interactions for the CCDP with SAHA, as well as for the CDDP with VPA combinations with respect to their anti-proliferative effects on three different lung cancer cell lines (A549, NCI-H1563 and NCI-H2170). Such additive effects were observed regardless of the histologic type (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) and sensitivity for the drugs applied. Combination treatment also augmented the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle perturbation mediated by CDDP alone, thereby enhancing anti-cancer effect of tested drugs. In conclusion, the combined therapy of HDIs and CDDP may be a promising therapeutic tool in the treatment of lung cancer.	NA	0
28042502	Verteporfin induces apoptosis and eliminates cancer stem-like cells in uveal melanoma in the absence of light activation.	Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary ocular malignancy in adults. Currently, no beneficial systemic therapy is available; therefore, there is an urgent need for effective targeted therapeutic drugs. As verteporfin has shown anti-neoplastic activity in several types of cancers, here we hypothesized and investigated the efficacy of verteporfin against UM cells without light activation. MTS assay, flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis, Western blotting of relevant proteins, transwell migration and invasion assay, melanosphere culture, and measurement of ALDH(+) populations, were used to evaluate the effects of verteporfin on UM cells. We found that verteporfin disrupted the interaction between YAP and TEAD4 in UM cells and decreased the expression of YAP targeted downstream genes. Verteporfin treatment decreased the cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of YAP and induced lysosome-dependent degradation of YAP protein. Verteporfin exhibited distinct inhibitory effect on the proliferation of four lines of UM cells (e.g., 92.1, Mel 270, Omm 1 and Omm 2.3), and induced apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway. Additionally, verteporfin suppressed migration and invasion of UM cells, impaired the traits of cancer stem-like cells (e.g., melanosphere formation capacity, and ALDH(+) cell population). This study demonstrated the anti-neoplastic activity of verteporfin against UM cells in vitro, providing a rationale for evaluating this agent in clinical investigation.	NA	0
28042501	A new PDAC mouse model originated from iPSCs-converted pancreatic cancer stem cells (CSCcm).	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most representative form of pancreatic cancers. PDAC solid tumours are constituted of heterogeneous populations of cells including cancer stem cells (CSCs), differentiated cancer cells, desmoplastic stroma and immune cells. The identification and consequent isolation of pancreatic CSCs facilitated the generation of genetically engineered murine models. Nonetheless, the current models may not be representative for the spontaneous tumour occurrence. In the present study, we show the generation of a novel pancreatic iPSC-converted cancer stem cell lines (CSCcm) as a cutting-edge model for the study of PDAC. The CSCcm lines were achieved only by the influence of pancreatic cancer cell lines conditioned medium and were not subjected to any genetic manipulation. The xenografts tumours from CSCcm lines displayed histopathological features of ADM, PanIN and PDAC lesions. Further molecular characterization from RNA-sequencing analysis highlighted primary culture cell lines (1(st) CSCcm) as potential candidates to represent the pancreatic CSCs and indicated the establishment of the pancreatic cancer molecular pattern in their subsequent progenies 2(nd) CSCcm and 3(rd) CSCcm. In addition, preliminary RNA-seq SNPs analysis showed that the distinct CSCcm lines did not harbour single point mutations for the oncogene Kras codon 12 or 13. Therefore, PDAC-CSCcm model may provide new insights about the actual occurrence of the pancreatic cancer leading to develop different approaches to target CSCs and abrogate the progression of this fatidic disease.

28042500	MicroRNA-147 suppresses human hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation migration and chemosensitivity by inhibiting HOXC6.	Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) experience poor prognosis and low survival rates. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism of microRNA-147 (miR-147) in regulating human HCC. We firstly used quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to compare the expression levels of miR-147 between 7 HCC and two normal liver cell lines, as well as 10 paired primary HCC tissues and their adjacent non-carcinoma tissues. We found miR-147 was down-regulated in both HCC cell lines and primary HCCs tissues. HCC cell lines HepG2 and HuH7 were transfected with lentiviral vector of miR-147 mimics. We found overexpressing miR-147 significantly inhibited HCC in vitro proliferation and migration, increased 5-FU chemosensitivity, and reduced in vivo tumorigenicity. Luciferase, qRT-PCR and western blot assays showed that HOXC6 was the downstream target of miR-147, and both gene and protein levels of HOXC6 were down-regulated by miR-147 in HCC cells. SiRNA mediated HOXC6 knockdown inhibited in vitro proliferation and migration, and increased 5-FU chemosensitivity in HCC. On the other hand, HOXC6 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-147 on HCC in vitro proliferation. Therefore, our results suggest that miR-147 can modulates HCC development through the regulation on HOXC6.	NA	2
28042499	PCAF acts as a gastric cancer suppressor through a novel PCAF-p16-CDK4 axis.	Gastric cancer (GC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and the pathogenesis of GC remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which P300/CBP associating factor (PCAF) acts as a tumor suppressor in GC cells. We showed that both PCAF mRNA and protein were downregulated in GC cells, and that this downregulation correlated with poor survival. Meanwhile, the interaction between human anion exchanger 1 (AE1) and p16 is a key event in GC development. We found that PCAF inhibited GC growth by interacting with AE1 and p16 to promote ubiquitin-mediated degradation of AE1 and p16 upregulation and translocation into the nucleus. Binding of nuclear p16 to CDK4 prevented the CDK4-Cyclin D1 interaction to inhibit GC proliferation. Furthermore, reduced PCAF levels in GC cells were associated with intracellular alkalinization and decreased immunity. Together these results suggest that PCAF acts as a GC suppressor through a novel PCAF-p16-CDK4 axis. The downregulation of PCAF expression in GC cells that follows intracellular alkalinization and decreased immune response, indicates that GC therapies should focus on restoring PCAF levels.	prognostic	1
28042498	Alpinumisoflavone induces apoptosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by modulating miR-370/PIM1 signaling.	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most prevalent type of esophageal cancer and accumulating evidence has confirmed the role of miRNAs in ESCC. One such miRNA, miR-370, was found to be aberrantly downregulated in various human malignancies. This study showed that the expression of miR-370 was significantly lower in ESCC tissues and cell lines, and miR-370 functioned as a tumor suppressor in ESCC. Moreover, this is the first report that showed miR-370 suppresses cell proliferation and tumor growth by directly targeting Pim family kinases 1 (PIM1). Furthermore, alpinumisoflavone, a naturally occurring flavonoid, could inhibit tumor growth of ESCC by targeting miR-370/PIM1 signaling.	NA	2
28042497	Regulation and role of post-translational modifications of enhancer of zeste homologue 2 in cancer development.	Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are critical molecular events which alter protein conformation after their synthesis and diversity protein properties by modulating their stability, localization, interacting partners or the activity of their substrates, consequently exerting pivotal roles in regulating the functions of many important eukaryotic proteins. It has been well acknowledged that PTMs are of great importance in a broad range of biological processes such as gene regulation, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, tissue development, diseases, tumor progression and drug resistance. As the core and contributing catalytic subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 2(PRC2), Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a master epigenetic regulator, often serving as a highly conserved histone methyltransferase (HMTase) to induce histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and repress gene transcription and expression. Dysregulated EZH2 expression is frequently associated with cancer development and poor prognosis in a wide variety of cancers. Considered its essential role in carcinogenesis, EZH2 is a potential candidate for cancer targeted therapy. Remarkably, mounting evidence highlights that EZH2 expression, activity and stability can be regulated by PTMs including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation and GlcNAcylation aside from its well-validated modifications in transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms underlying EZH2 PTMs and whether other types of PTMs orchestrate in EZH2 remain largely unclear. In this review, we summarize current advances in the understanding of EZH2 regulation by PTMs and their associated biological functions during tumorigenesis.	NA	0
28050232	Identification of CETP as a molecular target for estrogen positive breast cancer cell death by cholesterol depleting agents.	Cholesterol and its metabolites act as steroid hormone precursors, which promote estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) progression. Development of cholesterol targeting anticancer drugs has been hindered due to the lack of knowledge of viable molecular targets. Till now, Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) has been envisaged as a feasible molecular target in atherosclerosis, but for the first time, we show that CETP contributes to BC cell survival when challenged with cholesterol depleting agents. We show that MCF-7 CETP knockout BC cells pose less resistance towards cytotoxic compounds (Tamoxifen and Acetyl Plumbagin (AP)), and were more susceptible to intrinsic apoptosis. Analysis of differentially expressed genes using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), in vivo tumor inhibition, and in vitro phenotypic responses to AP revealed a unique CETP-centric cholesterol pathway involved in sensitizing ER+ BC cells to intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis. Furthermore, analysis of cell line, tissue and patient data available in publicly available databases linked elevated CETP expression to cancer, cancer relapse and overall poor survival. Overall, our findings highlight CETP as a pharmacologically relevant and unexploited cellular target in BC. The work also highlights AP as a promising chemical entity for preclinical investigations as a cholesterol depleting anticancer therapeutic agent.	NA	0
28050231	Treatment of patients with refractory metastatic cancer according to molecular profiling on tumor tissue in the clinical routine: an interim-analysis of the ONCO-T-PROFILE project.	INTRODUCTION: Patients with refractory metastatic cancer have been shown to benefit from molecular profiling of tumor tissue. The ONCO-T-PROFILE project was launched in March 2014 at the Innsbruck Medical University. Within 2 years our project aims to recruit 110 patients with stage IV cancer refractory to standard therapy. Our data presented here are based on an interim-analysis.METHODS: Tumor tissue specimens were submitted for molecular profiling to the certified laboratory (Caris Life Science, USA). Druggable tumor targets were selected based on biomarker status to agents with potential clinical benefit. Clinical benefit was defined as a PFS ratio (=PFS upon treatment according to the molecular profile/ PFS upon the last prior therapy) ≥ 1.3.RESULTS: As of April 2015, tumors from 50 patients have been molecularly profiled and one or more targets were detectable in 48 specimens (98%). So far, 19 (38%) patients have been treated according to their molecular tumor profile. To date, 8 (42%) patients have reached a PFS ratio of ≥ 1.3.CONCLUSIONS: We could show that molecular profiling is feasible in the clinical routine. A proportion of patients might benefit from an individualized treatment approach based on molecular profiling. As a result, we will proceed to enroll patients in ONCO-T-PROFILE.	NA	2
28050230	Givinostat, a type II histone deacetylase inhibitor, induces potent caspase-dependent apoptosis in human lymphoblastic leukemia.	Unlike chronic myeloid leukemia, patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+) do not respond well to Imatinib or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). In addition, TKI might induce resistant mutations in kinase domain (KD) of ABL in patients with relapsed diseases. Of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) has shown to induce potent cytotoxicity on acute myeloid leukemia cell lines but Givinostat effect on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has not been reported. We investigated if Givinostat could exert similar inhibitory effect on SUP-B15, an established B-cell ALL with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+). Two Ph+ leukemia cell lines, SUP-B15 and an AML cell line K562 were studied in parallel for their responses to Givinostat. Mutation status of TP53 genes was also examined to correlate cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Givinostat significantly inhibited cell proliferation of SUP-B15 (IC50:0.18±0.03μM) and simultaneously inhibited BCR-ABL signal pathway. A remarkable apoptosis was induced by 0.25μM Givinostat in SUP-B15 along with the activation of caspase cascades and increased expression of p21. These inhibitory and proapoptotic effects were not observed in K562 simultaneously treated with Givinostat. Finally our studies showed that TP53 mutation status might determine responder or non-responder to Givinostat in these two Ph+ leukemia cell lines.	therapeutic	2
28050229	Dual function of MDM2 and MDMX toward the tumor suppressors p53 and RB.	The orchestrated crosstalk between the retinoblastoma (RB) and p53 pathways contributes to preserving proper homeostasis within the cell. The deregulation of one or both pathways is a common factor in the development of most types of human cancer. The proto-oncoproteins MDMX and MDM2 are the main regulators of the well- known tumor suppressor p53 protein. Under normal conditions, MDM2 and MDMX inhibit p53, either via repression of its transcriptional activity by protein-protein interaction, or via polyubiquitination as a result of MDM2-E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, for which MDM2 needs to dimerize with MDMX. Under genotoxic stress conditions, both become positive regulators of p53. The ATM-dependent phosphorylation of MDM2 and MDMX allow them to bind p53 mRNA, these interactions promote p53 translation. MDM2 and MDMX are also being revealed as effective regulators of the RB protein. MDM2 is able to degrade RB by two different mechanisms, that is, by ubiquitin dependent and independent pathways. MDMX enhances the ability of MDM2 to bind and degrade RB protein. However, MDMX also seems to stabilize RB through interaction and competition with MDM2. Here, we will contextualize the findings that suggest that the MDM2 and MDMX proteins have a dual function on both p53 and RB.	NA	0
28040849	Rejection versus escape: the tumor MHC dilemma.	Most tumor cells derive from MHC-I-positive normal counterparts and remain positive at early stages of tumor development. T lymphocytes can infiltrate tumor tissue, recognize and destroy MHC class I (MHC-I)-positive cancer cells (&quot;permissive&quot; phase I). Later, MHC-I-negative tumor cell variants resistant to T-cell killing emerge. During this process, tumors first acquire a heterogeneous MHC-I expression pattern and finally become uniformly MHC-I-negative. This stage (phase II) represents a &quot;non-permissive&quot; encapsulated structure with tumor nodes surrounded by fibrous tissue containing different elements including leukocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, etc. Molecular mechanisms responsible for total or partial MHC-I downregulation play a crucial role in determining and predicting the antigen-presenting capacity of cancer cells. MHC-I downregulation caused by reversible (&quot;soft&quot;) lesions can be upregulated by TH1-type cytokines released into the tumor microenvironment in response to different types of immunotherapy. In contrast, when the molecular mechanism of the tumor MHC-I loss is irreversible (&quot;hard&quot;) due to a genetic defect in the gene/s coding for MHC-I heavy chains (chromosome 6) or beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) (chromosome 15), malignant cells are unable to upregulate MHC-I, remain undetectable by cytotoxic T-cells, and continue to grow and metastasize. Based on the tumor MHC-I molecular analysis, it might be possible to define MHC-I phenotypes present in cancer patients in order to distinguish between non-responders, partial/short-term responders, and likely durable responders. This highlights the need for designing strategies to enhance tumor MHC-I expression that would allow CTL-mediated tumor rejection.	NA	0
28053024	Molecular Pathways: Revisiting Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β as a target for the treatment of cancer.	Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), a serine/threonine protein kinase, is a complex regulator of numerous cellular functions. GSK-3β is a unique kinase which is constitutively active in resting and non-stimulated cells. GSK-3β has been implicated in a wide range of diseases including neurodegeneration, inflammation and fibrosis, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and cancer. It is a regulator of NF-κB-mediated survival of cancer cells, which provided a rationale for the development of GSK-3 inhibitors targeting malignant tumors. Recent studies, many of them reported over the past decade, have identified GSK-3β as a potential therapeutic target in at over 15 different types of cancer. Whereas only active GSK-3β is expressed in cancer cell nucleus, aberrant nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β has been identified as a hallmark of cancer cells in malignant tumors of different origin. This review focuses on the preclinical and clinical development of GSK-3 inhibitors, and the potential therapeutic impact of targeting GSK-3β in human cancer.	NA	0
28053023	Ricolinostat, the first selective histone deacetylase 6 inhibitor, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.	PURPOSE: Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition improves the efficacy of proteasome inhibition for multiple myeloma but adds substantial toxicity. Preclinical models suggest that the observed synergy is due to the role of HDAC6 in mediating resistance to proteasome inhibition via the aggresome/autophagy pathway of protein degradation.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a phase 1/2 trial of the HDAC6-selective inhibitor ricolinostat to define the safety, preliminary efficacy, and recommended phase 2 dose in combination with standard proteasome inhibitor therapy. Patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma received oral ricolinostat on days 1-5 and 8-12 of each 21-day cycle.RESULTS: Single agent ricolinostat therapy resulted in neither significant toxicity nor clinical responses. Combination therapy with bortezomib and dexamethasone was well tolerated during dose escalation but led to dose-limiting diarrhea in an expansion cohort at a ricolinostat dose of 160 mg twice daily. Combination therapy at a ricolinostat dose of 160 mg daily in a second expansion cohort was well tolerated, with less severe hematologic, gastrointestinal, and constitutional toxicities compared with published data on non-selective HDAC inhibitors. The overall response rate in combination with daily ricolinostat at ≥160 mg was 37%. The response rate to combination therapy among bortezomib-refractory patients was 14%. Samples taken during therapy showed dose-dependent increases of acetylated tubulin in peripheral blood lymphocytes.CONCLUSIONS: At the recommended phase 2 dose of ricolinostat of 160 mg daily, the combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone is safe, well tolerated, and active, suggesting that selective inhibition of HDAC6 is a promising approach to multiple myeloma therapy.

28053022	Phase 1 Study of ONT-380, a HER2 Inhibitor, in Patients with HER2+ Advanced Solid Tumors, with an Expansion Cohort in HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC).	PURPOSE: ONT-380 (ARRY-380) is a potent and selective oral HER2 inhibitor. This Phase 1 study determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK) and antitumor activity of ONT-380 in HER2 positive advanced solid tumors, with an expansion cohort of patients with HER2-positive MBC.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ONT-380 was administered twice daily (BID) in continuous 28-day cycles. After a modified 3+3 dose escalation design determined the MTD, the expansion cohort was enrolled. PK properties of ONT-380 and a metabolite were determined. Response was evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).RESULTS: Fifty patients received ONT-380 (escalation=33; expansion=17); 43 patients had HER2+MBC. Median prior anti-cancer regimens=5. Dose limiting toxicities of increased transaminases occurred at 800mg BID, thus 600mg BID was the MTD. Common AEs were usually Grade 1/2 in severity and included nausea (56%), diarrhea (52%), fatigue (50%), vomiting (40%) constipation, pain in extremity and cough (20% each). 5 patients (19%) treated at MTD had grade 3 AEs (increased transaminases, rash, night sweats, anemia and hypokalemia). The half-life of ONT-380 was 5.38 hours and increases in exposure were approximately dose proportional. In evaluable HER2+MBC (n=22) treated at doses ≥ MTD, the response rate was 14% [all partial response (PR)] and the clinical benefit rate (PR+stable disease ≥ 24 weeks) was 27%.CONCLUSIONS: ONT-380 had a lower incidence and severity of diarrhea and rash than that typically associated with current dual HER2/EGFR inhibitors and showed notable anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated HER2+MBC patients, supporting its continued development.	therapeutic	1
28053021	First-in-Human Phase 1 Study of the Oral Inhibitor of Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 Epacadostat (INCB024360) in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies.	PURPOSE: Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) catalyzes the degradation of tryptophan to N-formyl-kynurenine. Overexpressed in many solid malignancies, IDO1 can promote tumor escape from host immunosurveillance. This first-in-human phase 1 study investigated the maximum tolerated dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of epacadostat (INCB024360), a potent and selective inhibitor of IDO1.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients with advanced solid malignancies were treated with epacadostat (50 mg once daily or 50, 100, 300, 400, 500, 600, or 700 mg twice daily [BID]) in a dose-escalation 3 + 3 design and evaluated in 28-day cycles. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.RESULTS: One dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred at the dose of 300 mg BID (grade 3, radiation pneumonitis); another DLT occurred at 400 mg BID (grade 3, fatigue). The most common adverse events in &gt;20% of patients overall were fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspnea, back pain, and cough. Treatment produced significant dose-dependent reductions in plasma kynurenine levels and in the plasma kynurenine/tryptophan ratio at all doses and in all patients. Near maximal changes were observed at doses of ≥100 mg BID with &gt;80% to 90% inhibition of IDO1 achieved throughout the dosing period. Although no objective responses were detected, stable disease lasting ≥16 weeks was observed in 7 of 52 patients.CONCLUSIONS: Epacadostat was generally well tolerated, effectively normalized kynurenine levels, and produced maximal inhibition of IDO1 activity at doses of &gt;100 mg BID. Studies investigating epacadostat in combination with other immunomodulatory drugs are ongoing.	therapeutic	1
28053020	Blocking tumor-educated MSC paracrine activity halts osteosarcoma progression.	PURPOSE: Human osteosarcoma is a genetically heterogeneous bone malignancy with poor prognosis despite the employment of aggressive chemotherapy regimens. Because druggable driver mutations have not been established, dissecting the interactions between osteosarcoma cells and supporting stroma may provide insights into novel therapeutic targets.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: By using a bioluminescent orthotopic xenograft mouse model of osteosarcoma we evaluated the effect of tumor extracellular vesicle (EV)-educated mesenchymal stem cells (TEMSCs) on osteosarcoma progression. Characterization and functional studies were designed to assess the mechanisms underlying MSC education. Independent series of tissue specimens were analyzed to corroborate the preclinical findings, and the composition of patient serum EVs was analyzed after isolation with size-exclusion chromatography.RESULTS: We show that EVs secreted by highly malignant osteosarcoma cells selectively incorporate a membrane-associated form of TGFB, which induces pro-inflammatory IL-6 production by MSCs. TEMSCs promote tumor growth, accompanied with intratumor STAT3 activation and lung metastasis formation, which was not observed with control MSCs. Importantly, intravenous administration of the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab abrogated the tumor-promoting effects of TEMSCs. RNA-seq analysis of human osteosarcoma tissues revealed a distinct TGFB-induced pro-metastatic gene signature. Tissue microarray immunostaining indicated active STAT3 signaling in human osteosarcoma, consistent with the observations in TEMSC-treated mice. Finally, we isolated pure populations of EVs from serum and demonstrated that circulating levels of EV-associated TGFB are increased in osteosarcoma patients.CONCLUSION: Collectively, our findings suggest that TEMSCs promote osteosarcoma progression and provide the basis for testing IL-6 and TGFB blocking agents as new therapeutic strategies for osteosarcoma patients.

28056206	Efficacy and Safety of Nivolumab Alone or in Combination With Ipilimumab in Patients With Mucosal Melanoma: A Pooled Analysis.	Purpose Mucosal melanoma is an aggressive malignancy with a poor response to conventional therapies. The efficacy and safety of nivolumab (a programmed death-1 checkpoint inhibitor), alone or combined with ipilimumab (a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 checkpoint inhibitor), have not been reported in this rare melanoma subtype. Patients and Methods Data were pooled from 889 patients who received nivolumab monotherapy in clinical studies, including phase III trials; 86 (10%) had mucosal melanoma and 665 (75%) had cutaneous melanoma. Data were also pooled for patients who received nivolumab combined with ipilimumab (n = 35, mucosal melanoma; n = 326, cutaneous melanoma). Results Among patients who received nivolumab monotherapy, median progression-free survival was 3.0 months (95% CI, 2.2 to 5.4 months) and 6.2 months (95% CI, 5.1 to 7.5 months) for mucosal and cutaneous melanoma, with objective response rates of 23.3% (95% CI, 14.8% to 33.6%) and 40.9% (95% CI, 37.1% to 44.7%), respectively. Median progression-free survival in patients treated with nivolumab combined with ipilimumab was 5.9 months (95% CI, 2.8 months to not reached) and 11.7 months (95% CI, 8.9 to 16.7 months) for mucosal and cutaneous melanoma, with objective response rates of 37.1% (95% CI, 21.5% to 55.1%) and 60.4% (95% CI, 54.9% to 65.8%), respectively. For mucosal and cutaneous melanoma, respectively, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events was 8.1% and 12.5% for nivolumab monotherapy and 40.0% and 54.9% for combination therapy. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the largest analysis of data for anti-programmed death-1 therapy in mucosal melanoma to date. Nivolumab combined with ipilimumab seemed to have greater efficacy than either agent alone, and although the activity was lower in mucosal melanoma, the safety profile was similar between subtypes.

28056205	Evaluation of a Web-Based Cognitive Rehabilitation Program in Cancer Survivors Reporting Cognitive Symptoms After Chemotherapy.	Purpose Cognitive impairment is reported frequently by cancer survivors. There are no proven treatments. We evaluated a cognitive rehabilitation program (Insight) and compared it with standard care in cancer survivors self-reporting cognitive symptoms. Patients and Methods We recruited adult cancer survivors with a primary malignancy (excluding central nervous system malignancies) who had completed three or more cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy in the previous 6 to 60 months and reported persistent cognitive symptoms. All participants received a 30-minute telephone consultation and were then randomly assigned to the 15-week, home-based intervention or to standard care. Primary outcome was self-reported cognitive function (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Cognitive Function [FACT-COG] perceived cognitive impairment [PCI] subscale): difference between groups after intervention (T2) and 6 months later (T3). Results A total of 242 participants were randomly assigned: median age, 53 years; 95% female. The primary outcome of difference in FACT-COG PCI was significant, with less PCI in the intervention group at T2 ( P &lt; .001). This difference was sustained at T3 ( P &lt; .001). At T2, there was a significant difference in all FACT-COG subscales, favoring the intervention. Neuropsychological results were not significantly different between the groups at T2 or T3. There were significantly lower levels of anxiety/depression and fatigue in the intervention group at T2. There were significant improvements in stress in the intervention group at both time points. There was no significant difference in quality of life between the groups at T2, but the intervention group had better quality of life at T3. Conclusion The intervention, Insight, led to improvements in cognitive symptoms compared with standard care. To our knowledge, this is the first large randomized controlled trial showing an improvement in self-reported cognitive function in cancer survivors, indicating that this intervention is a feasible treatment.

28056203	Postinduction Minimal Residual Disease Predicts Outcome and Benefit From Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Acute Myeloid Leukemia With NPM1 Mutation: A Study by the Acute Leukemia French Association Group.	Purpose This study assessed the prognostic impact of postinduction NPM1-mutated ( NPM1m) minimal residual disease (MRD) in young adult patients (age, 18 to 60 years) with acute myeloid leukemia, and addressed the question of whether NPM1m MRD may be used as a predictive factor of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) benefit. Patients and Methods Among 229 patients with NPM1m who were treated in the Acute Leukemia French Association 0702 (ALFA-0702) trial, MRD evaluation was available in 152 patients in first remission. Patients with nonfavorable AML according to the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) classification were eligible for ASCT in first remission. Results After induction therapy, patients who did not achieve a 4-log reduction in NPM1m peripheral blood-MRD (PB-MRD) had a higher cumulative incidence of relapse (subhazard ratio [SHR], 5.83; P &lt; .001) and a shorter overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 10.99; P &lt; .001). In multivariable analysis, an abnormal karyotype, the presence of FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD), and a &lt; 4-log reduction in PB-MRD were significantly associated with a higher relapse incidence and shorter OS. In the subset of patients with FLT3-ITD, only age, white blood cell count, and &lt; 4-log reduction in PB-MRD, but not FLT3-ITD allelic ratio, remained of significant prognostic value. In these patients with nonfavorable AML according to European LeukemiaNet, disease-free survival and OS were significantly improved by ASCT in those with a &lt; 4-log reduction in PB-MRD. This benefit was not observed in those with a &gt; 4-log reduction in PB-MRD, with a significant interaction between ASCT effect and PB-MRD response ( P = .024 and .027 for disease-free survival and OS, respectively). Conclusion Our study supports the strong prognostic significance of early NPM1m PB-MRD, independent of the cytogenetic and molecular context. Moreover, NPM1m PB-MRD may be used as a predictive factor for ASCT indication.	prognostic	1

Patients and Methods Among 229 patients with NPM1m who were treated in the Acute Leukemia French Association 0702 (ALFA-0702) trial, MRD evaluation was available in 152 patients in first remission. Patients with nonfavorable AML according to the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) classification were eligible for ASCT in first remission. Results After induction therapy, patients who did not achieve a 4-log reduction in NPM1m peripheral blood-MRD (PB-MRD) had a higher cumulative incidence of relapse (subhazard ratio [SHR], 5.83; P &lt; .001) and a shorter overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 10.99; P &lt; .001). In multivariable analysis, an abnormal karyotype, the presence of FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD), and a &lt; 4-log reduction in PB-MRD were significantly associated with a higher relapse incidence and shorter OS. In the subset of patients with FLT3-ITD, only age, white blood cell count, and &lt; 4-log reduction in PB-MRD, but not FLT3-ITD allelic ratio, remained of significant prognostic value. In these patients with nonfavorable AML according to European LeukemiaNet, disease-free survival and OS were significantly improved by ASCT in those with a &lt; 4-log reduction in PB-MRD. This benefit was not observed in those with a &gt; 4-log reduction in PB-MRD, with a significant interaction between ASCT effect and PB-MRD response ( P = .024 and .027 for disease-free survival and OS, respectively). Conclusion Our study supports the strong prognostic significance of early NPM1m PB-MRD, independent of the cytogenetic and molecular context. Moreover, NPM1m PB-MRD may be used as a predictive factor for ASCT indication.	NA	1

28056202	Trastuzumab Emtansine With or Without Pertuzumab Versus Trastuzumab Plus Taxane for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive, Advanced Breast Cancer: Primary Results From the Phase III MARIANNE Study.	Purpose Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -targeted monoclonal antibodies, and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate that combines the properties of trastuzumab with the cytotoxic activity of DM1. T-DM1 demonstrated encouraging efficacy and safety in a phase II study of patients with previously untreated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Combination T-DM1 and pertuzumab showed synergistic activity in cell culture models and had an acceptable safety profile in a phase Ib and II study. Methods In the MARIANNE study, 1,095 patients with centrally assessed, HER2-positive, advanced breast cancer and no prior therapy for advanced disease were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to control (trastuzumab plus taxane), T-DM1 plus placebo, hereafter T-DM1, or T-DM1 plus pertuzumab at standard doses. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by independent review. Results T-DM1 and T-DM1 plus pertuzumab showed noninferior PFS compared with trastuzumab plus taxane (median PFS: 13.7 months with trastuzumab plus taxane, 14.1 months with T-DM1, and 15.2 months with T-DM1 plus pertuzumab). Neither experimental arm showed PFS superiority to trastuzumab plus taxane. Response rate was 67.9% in patients who were treated with trastuzumab plus taxane, 59.7% with T-DM1, and 64.2% with T-DM1 plus pertuzumab; median response duration was 12.5 months, 20.7 months, and 21.2 months, respectively. The incidence of grade ≥ 3 adverse events was numerically higher in the control arm (54.1%) versus the T-DM1 arm (45.4%) and T-DM1 plus pertuzumab arm (46.2%). Numerically fewer patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events in the T-DM1 arms, and health-related quality of life was maintained for longer in the T-DM1 arms. Conclusion T-DM1 showed noninferior, but not superior, efficacy and better tolerability than did taxane plus trastuzumab for first-line treatment of HER2-positive, advanced breast cancer.	NA	2
28056201	Predictors of and Trends in High-Intensity End-of-Life Care Among Children With Cancer: A Population-Based Study Using Health Services Data.	Purpose Children with cancer often receive high-intensity (HI) medical care at the end-of-life (EOL). Previous studies have been limited to single centers or lacked detailed clinical data. We determined predictors of and trends in HI-EOL care by linking population-based clinical and health-services databases. Methods A retrospective decedent cohort of patients with childhood cancer who died between 2000 and 2012 in Ontario, Canada, was assembled using a provincial cancer registry and linked to population-based health-care data. Based on previous studies, the primary composite measure of HI-EOL care comprised any of the following: intravenous chemotherapy &lt; 14 days from death; more than one emergency department visit; and more than one hospitalization or intensive care unit admission &lt; 30 days from death. Secondary measures included those same individual measures and measures of the most invasive (MI) EOL care (eg, mechanical ventilation &lt; 14 days from death). We determined predictors of outcomes with appropriate regression models. Sensitivity analysis was restricted to cases of cancer-related mortality, excluding treatment-related mortality (TRM) cases. Results The study included 815 patients; of these, 331 (40.6%) experienced HI-EOL care. Those with hematologic malignancies were at highest risk (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.8 to 3.6; P &lt; .001). Patients with hematologic cancers and those who died after 2004 were more likely to experience the MI-EOL care (eg, intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, odds ratios from 2.0 to 5.1). Excluding cases of TRM did not substantively change the results. Conclusion Ontario children with cancer continue to experience HI-EOL care. Patients with hematologic malignancies are at highest risk even when excluding TRM. Of concern, rates of the MI-EOL care have increased over time despite increased palliative care access. Linking health services and clinical data allows monitoring of population trends in EOL care and identifies high-risk populations for future interventions.	NA	0
28056193	Reduced CD62L Expression on T Cells and Increased Soluble CD62L Levels Predict Molecular Response to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy in Early Chronic-Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia.	Purpose Immunologic surveillance of minimal residual disease in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) may be relevant for long-term control or cure of CML. Little is known about immune-modulatory effects of nilotinib in vivo, potentially predicting response to therapy. Patients and Methods A prospective and comprehensive flow cytometry-based immunomonitoring program paralleled the ENEST1st clinical study, investigating 52 nilotinib-naïve patients with chronic-phase CML. Data were verified in independent validation cohorts. Results T cells of patients with CML at diagnosis expressed low l-selectin (CD62L) levels, which was not a result of proportional aberrations of T-cell subsets. Low numbers of CD62L-expressing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells correlated with higher Sokal score, increased spleen size, and high leukocyte and peripheral-blood blast counts. At month 6 during nilotinib therapy, CD62L expression returned to levels of healthy individuals. The level of CD62L loss on T cells directly correlated with the extent of soluble CD62L (sCD62L) elevation. In parallel, the proteolytic activity of tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme (TACE; ADAM17, CD156b), the metalloproteinase shedding CD62L, was increased at diagnosis and significantly decreased during nilotinib treatment. High CD62L(+) expression on both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and, vice versa, low sCD62L levels at CML diagnosis were linked to superior molecular responses. These findings were corroborated in independent validation cohorts. Conclusion We demonstrate the prognostic impact of CD62L shedding from T cells and increased sCD62L plasma levels at CML diagnosis on molecular response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in early chronic-phase CML. Functionally, decreased CD62L may be a consequence of increased TACE-mediated CD62L cleavage and potentially impairs immune-cell function. Larger prospective studies are ongoing to confirm the prognostic relevance of this finding.	NA	2
28053195	TCR-based therapy for multiple myeloma and other B-cell malignancies targeting intracellular transcription factor BOB1.	Immunotherapy of hematological malignancies or solid tumors by administration of monoclonal antibodies or T-cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors or T-cell receptors (TCRs) has demonstrated clinical efficacy. However, antigen-loss tumor escape variants and the absence of currently targeted antigens on several malignancies hampers the widespread application of immunotherapy. We have isolated a TCR targeting a peptide of the intracellular B-cell specific transcription factor BOB1 presented in the context of HLA-B*07:02. TCR gene transfer installed BOB1-specificity and reactivity onto recipient T-cells. TCR-transduced T-cells efficiently lysed primary B-cell leukemia, mantel cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma in vitro. We also observed recognition and lysis of healthy BOB1-expressing B-cells. In addition, strong BOB1-specific proliferation could be demonstrated for TCR-modified T-cells upon antigen encounter. Furthermore, clear in vivo antitumor reactivity was observed of BOB1-specific TCR-engineered T-cells in a xenograft mouse model of established multiple myeloma. Absence of reactivity towards a broad panel of BOB1-negative but HLA-B*07:02(pos) nonhematopoietic and hematopoietic cells indicated no off-target toxicity. Therefore, administration of BOB1-specific TCR-engineered T-cells may provide novel cellular treatment options to patients suffering from B-cell malignancies including multiple myeloma.	NA	2
28053194	miR-125b promotes MLL-AF9-driven murine acute myeloid leukemia involving a VEGFA-mediated non-cell-intrinsic mechanism.	The hematopoietic-stem-cell-enriched miR-125-family miRNAs are critical regulators of hematopoiesis. Overexpression of miR-125a or miR-125b are frequent in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and their overexpression in mice leads to expansion of hematopoietic stem cells accompanied by perturbed hematopoiesis with mostly myeloproliferative phenotypes. However, whether and how miR-125 family miRNAs cooperate with known AML oncogenes in vivo, and how the resultant leukemia is dependent on miR-125 overexpression is not well understood. We modeled the frequent co-occurrence of miR-125b overexpression and MLL-translocations by examining functional cooperation between miR-125b and MLL-AF9 By generating a knock-in mouse model in which miR-125b overexpression is controlled by doxycycline (Dox) induction, we demonstrate that miR-125b significantly enhances MLL-AF9-driven AML in vivo and the resultant leukemia is partially dependent on continued overexpression of miR-125b Surprisingly, miR-125b promotes AML cell expansion and suppresses apoptosis involving a non-cell-intrinsic mechanism. MiR-125b expression enhances VEGFA expression and production from leukemia cells, in part by suppressing TET2 Recombinant VEGFA recapitulates miR-125b's leukemia-promoting effects, whereas knockdown of VEGFA or inhibition of VEGFR2 abolishes miR-125b's effects. In addition, significant correlation between miR-125b and VEGFA expression is observed in human AMLs. Our data reveal cooperative and dependent relationships between miR-125b and MLL oncogene in AML leukemogenesis, and demonstrate a miR-125b-TET2-VEGFA pathway in mediating non-cell-intrinsic leukemia promoting effects by an oncogenic miRNA.

28053193	Promyelocytic extracellular chromatin exacerbates coagulation and fibrinolysis in acute promyelocytic leukemia.	Despite routine treatment of unselected acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), early death due to hemorrhage remains unacceptably common and the mechanism underlying this complication remains elusive. We have recently demonstrated that APL cells undergo a novel cell death program, termed ETosis, which involves release of extracellular chromatin. However, the role of promyelocytic extracellular chromatin in APL-associated coagulation remains unclear. Our objectives were to identify the novel role of ATRA-promoted extracellular chromatin in inducing a hypercoagulable and hyperfibrinolytic state in APL and to evaluate its interaction with fibrin and endothelial cells (ECs). Results from a series of coagulation assays have shown that promyelocytic extracellular chromatin increases thrombin and plasmin generation, causes a shortening of plasma clotting time of APL cells, and increases fibrin formation. DNase I but not anti-tissue factor antibody could inhibit these effects. Immunofluorescence staining showed that promyelocytic extracellular chromatin and phosphatidylserine on APL cells provide platforms for fibrin deposition and render clots more resistant to fibrinolysis. Additionally, co-incubation assays revealed that promyelocytic extracellular chromatin is cytotoxic to ECs, converting them to a procoagulant phenotype. This cytotoxity was blocked by DNase I by 20% or activated protein C (APC) by 31%. Our current results thus delineate the pathogenic role of promyelocytic extracellular chromatin in APL coagulopathy. Furthermore, the remaining coagulation disturbance in high-risk APL patients after ATRA administration may be treatable by intrinsic pathway inhibition via accelerating extracellular chromatin degradation.

28053192	Mature CD10+ and immature CD10- neutrophils present in G-CSF-treated donors display opposite effects on T cells.	The identification of discrete neutrophil populations, as well as the characterization of their immunoregulatory properties, is an emerging topic under extensive investigation. In such regard, the presence of circulating CD66b(+)-neutrophil populations, exerting either immunosuppressive or proinflammatory functions, has been described in several acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. However, due to the lack of specific markers, the precise phenotype and maturation status of these neutrophil populations remain unclear. Herein, we report that CD10, also known as common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA), or neutral endopeptidase (NEP), or enkephalinase, can be used as a marker that, within heterogeneous populations of circulating CD66b(+)-neutrophils present in inflammatory conditions, clearly distinguishes the mature from the immature ones. Accordingly, we observed that the previously described immunosuppressive neutrophil population that appears in the circulation of healthy volunteers receiving G-CSF for stem cell mobilization (GDs) consists of mature CD66b(+)CD10(+)-neutrophils displaying an activated phenotype. These neutrophils inhibit proliferation and IFNγ production by T cells via a CD18-mediated contact-dependent arginase 1 release. By contrast, we found that immature CD66b(+)CD10(-)-neutrophils, also present in GDs, display an immature morphology, promote T-cell survival and enhance proliferation and IFNγ production by T cells. Altogether, our findings uncover that in GDs, circulating mature and immature neutrophils, distinguished by their differential CD10 expression, exert opposite immunoregulatory properties. Therefore, CD10 might be utilized as a phenotypic marker discriminating mature neutrophils from immature neutrophil populations present in patients with acute or chronic inflammatory conditions, as well as facilitating their isolation, to better define their specific immunoregulatory properties.

28055980	Immunohistochemical profiling of receptor tyrosine kinases, MED12, and TGF-βRII of surgically resected small cell lung cancer, and the potential of c-kit as a prognostic marker.	The limited number of available treatments for patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) has prompted us to further investigate the biology of SCLC by molecular profiling. We collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 127 patients with SCLC, who had undergone surgery at 16 institutions between January 2003 and January 2013, and analyzed the association between disease-specific survival and protein expression of c-kit, c-Met, epidermal growth factor receptor, human EGFR-related 2, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor II, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12), and transforming growth factor beta receptor II (TGF-βRII) by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Of the 125 evaluable samples, all tumors expressed MED12, and 123 samples (98.4%) expressed TGF-βRII. MED12 was highly expressed in the nucleus in 92% of the positive samples while TGF-βRII was highly expressed in the cytoplasm in 55% of the positive samples. High c-kit expression was an independent favorable prognostic marker confirmed by multivariate analysis (hazard ratio: 0.543, 95% confidence interval: 0.310-0.953, p = 0.033). Both the relapse free-survival and overall survival of patients who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy were statistically longer in those with high c-kit expression (n = 38) than those with intermediate, low, or no c-kit expression (n = 19) (not reached vs 11.6 months, p = 0.021; not reached vs 25.9 months, p = 0.028). IHC for c-kit may offer a prognostic marker for early-stage SCLC, and the results for MED12 and TGF-βRII may suggest the biological characteristics of SCLC. Further investigation of the roles of their related molecules in early stage SCLC is required.	NA	0
28055979	NA	Several evidences have shown that BRCA mutations increased tumor-cells sensitivity to PARP inhibitors by synthetic lethality leading to an accelerated development of several compounds targeting the PARP enzymes system as anticancer agents for clinical setting. Most of such compounds have been investigated in ovarian and breast cancer, showing promising efficacy in BRCA-mutated patients. Recently clinical studies of PARP-inhibitors have been extended across different tumor types harboring BRCA-mutations, including also &quot;BRCA-like&quot; sporadic tumors with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). This review summarizes the biological background underlying PARP-inhibition, reporting the results of the most relevant clinical trials carried out in patients treated with PARP inhibitors alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Molecular mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of both primary and acquired resistance have been elucidated, in order to support the development of new treatment strategies.	NA	2
28055978	Research progress of neuroblastoma related gene variations.	Neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid tumor among children, is an embryonal tumor originating from undifferentiated neural crest cell. Neuroblastomas are highly heterogeneous, represented by the wide range of clinical presentations and likelihood of cure, ranging from spontaneous regression to relentless progression despite rigorous multimodal treatments. Approximately, 50% of cases are high-risk with overall survival rates less than 40%. With the efforts to collect large numbers of clinically annotated specimens and the advancements in technologies, researchers have revealed numerous genetic alterations that may drive tumor growth. However, the most lack mutations in genes that are recurrently mutated, which inspires researchers to identify disrupted pathways instead of single mutated genes to unearth biological systems perturbed in neuroblastoma. Stratification of patients and target therapy based on their molecular signatures have been the center of focus. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the recent advances in identification of candidate genes variations, targeted approaches to high-risk neuroblastoma and evaluates the methods utilized for detection, which will provide new avenues to develop therapies and further genetic researches.

28055977	Risk factors of locoregional relapse in locally advanced breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy following mastectomy and radiotherapy.	We seek to investigate the prognostic factors that could possibly increase the locoregional recurrence of breast cancer patients who do not achieve pathological complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and to build a prognostic nomogram to predict patients' outcome. The retrospective analysis included 510 patients who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy. 62 locoregional events occurred after a median 61 months of follow-up. The five-year cumulative incidence of local recurrence and regional recurrence were 8.63% and 4.31%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that positivity for ≥ 4 lymph nodes and Ki-67 index ≥ 14% were independent factors. According to our prognostic model, the 5-year locoregional free survival rates in the low, intermediate, and high-risk groups were 95.5%, 89.1%, and 67.1%, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Annual recurrence curves indicated that the relapse peak after mastectomy emerged in the first 1 year. Positivity for ≥ 4 lymph nodes and Ki-67 index ≥ 14% were independent factors for locoregional recurrence. This prognostic model has considerable clinical value in predicting locoregional recurrence, which could help clinicians to design appropriate locoregional treatment specifically and to perform surveillance individually.

28055976	CD133 in brain tumor: the prognostic factor.	CD133 has been shown to be an important stem cell factor that promotes glioma progression. However, the mechanism for CD133-mediated glioma progression has yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we found that CD133 mRNA expression was a prognostic marker in three independent glioma patient cohorts, corroborating a putative role for CD133 in glioma progression. Importantly, we found that CD133 expression in glioma was highly correlated with the expression of HOX gene stem cell factors (HOXA5, HOXA7, HOXA10, HOXC4 and HOXC6). The expression of these HOX genes individually was significantly associated with survival. Interestingly, the prognostic significance of CD133 was dependent on the expression level of HOX genes, and vice versa. CD133 (p = 0.021) and HOXA7 (p = 0.001) were independent prognostic markers when the three glioma patient cohorts were combined (n = 231). Our results suggest that HOX genes may play a more important role in progression of glioma when CD133 expression is low. Furthermore, we showed that low-level expression of LIM2 in CD133-high glioma was associated with poorer survival, suggesting that LIM2 could be a therapeutic target for glioma expressing a high level of CD133. Connectivity mapping identified vinblastine and vincristine as agents that could reverse the CD133/HOX genes/LIM2-signature, and we confirmed this by in vitro analysis in glioma cell lines, demonstrating that CD133 and HOX genes were co-expressed and could be downregulated by vincristine. In conclusion, our data show that CD133 and HOX genes are important prognostic markers in glioma and shed light on possible treatment strategies for glioma expressing a high level of CD133.	prognostic	1

In this study, we found that CD133 mRNA expression was a prognostic marker in three independent glioma patient cohorts, corroborating a putative role for CD133 in glioma progression. Importantly, we found that CD133 expression in glioma was highly correlated with the expression of HOX gene stem cell factors (HOXA5, HOXA7, HOXA10, HOXC4 and HOXC6). The expression of these HOX genes individually was significantly associated with survival. Interestingly, the prognostic significance of CD133 was dependent on the expression level of HOX genes, and vice versa. CD133 (p = 0.021) and HOXA7 (p = 0.001) were independent prognostic markers when the three glioma patient cohorts were combined (n = 231). Our results suggest that HOX genes may play a more important role in progression of glioma when CD133 expression is low. Furthermore, we showed that low-level expression of LIM2 in CD133-high glioma was associated with poorer survival, suggesting that LIM2 could be a therapeutic target for glioma expressing a high level of CD133. Connectivity mapping identified vinblastine and vincristine as agents that could reverse the CD133/HOX genes/LIM2-signature, and we confirmed this by in vitro analysis in glioma cell lines, demonstrating that CD133 and HOX genes were co-expressed and could be downregulated by vincristine. In conclusion, our data show that CD133 and HOX genes are important prognostic markers in glioma and shed light on possible treatment strategies for glioma expressing a high level of CD133.	prognostic	1

28055975	Mitotic catastrophe and cell cycle arrest are alternative cell death pathways executed by bortezomib in rituximab resistant B-cell lymphoma cells.	The ubiqutin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a role in rituximab-chemotherapy resistance and bortezomib (BTZ) possesses caspase-dependent (i.e. Bak stabilization) and a less characterized caspase-independent mechanism-of-action(s). Here, we define BTZ-induced caspase-independent cell death pathways. A panel of rituximab-sensitive (RSCL), rituximab-resistant cell lines (RRCL) and primary tumor cells derived from lymphoma patients (N = 13) were exposed to BTZ. Changes in cell viability, cell-cycle, senescence, and mitotic index were quantified. In resting conditions, RRCL exhibits a low-proliferation rate, accumulation of cells in S-phase and senescence. Exposure of RRCL to BTZ reduces cell senescence, induced G2-M phase cell-cycle arrest, and is associated with mitotic catastrophe. BTZ stabilized p21, CDC2, and cyclin B in RRCL and in primary tumor cells. Transient p21 knockdown alleviates BTZ-induced senescence inhibition, G2-M cell cycle blockade, and mitotic catastrophe. Our data suggest that BTZ can induce apoptosis or mitotic catastrophe and that p21 has a pivotal role in BTZ activity against RRCL.	NA	0
28055973	Outcome and long-term efficacy of four facio-cervical fields conformal radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcomes of 255 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with four facio-cervical fields conformal radiotherapy (4F-CRT).RESULTS: In one patient's 3 different RT treatment modalities, the 4F-CRT techniques resulted in sharper of the dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for primary gross tumor volume (PGTVnx) and planning target volume (PTVnx), similar to the intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The median follow-up duration was 43 months. Locoregional relapse and distant metastases as the first treatment failure events occurred in 32 (32/255, 12.5%) and 20 (30/255, 11.8%) patients, respectively. The 3-year and 5-year local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 83.3%, 82%, 83.8%, and 76.1%, 73.2%, 76.3% respectively. Univariate analysis displayed that clinical stage, T-stage, N-stage, and tumor response were related to prognosis. Multivariate analysis indicated that age, T-stage, N-stage, and combined chemotherapy were independent prognosticators. The incidence of grade 1-2 acute mucositis and leukocytopenia were 93.7% and 91.0%, respectively, with no cases of grade 4 toxicity detected.MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2007 to December 2011, 255 patients with histologically diagnosed, non-metastatic NPC were enrolled into this study and received 4F-CRT. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the nasopharynx were performed on every patient. All patients received definitive radiotherapy with 6 MV X-rays using conventional fractions at 2 Gy daily, 5 fractions per week, and 231 patients with stage IIb-IV received concurrent chemotherapy and cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. The accumulated survival was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method; the log-rank test was used to compare survival differences. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox's proportional hazard model.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the conventional treatment plans, the 4F-CRT plan delivered more dose to cover the tumor volume and reduces the doses of the normal tissues including the parotid gland, TMJs and so on. The long-term efficacy of 4F-CRT is satisfactory and its toxicities are tolerable.	NA	0
28055972	Integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis for pinpointing recurrent alterations of plant homeodomain genes and their clinical significance in breast cancer.	A wide range of the epigenetic effectors that regulate chromatin modification, gene expression, genomic stability, and DNA repair contain structurally conserved domains called plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers. Alternations of several PHD finger-containing proteins (PHFs) due to genomic amplification, mutations, deletions, and translocations have been linked directly to various types of cancer. However, little is known about the genomic landscape and the clinical significance of PHFs in breast cancer. Hence, we performed a large-scale genomic and transcriptomic analysis of 98 PHF genes in breast cancer using TCGA and METABRIC datasets and correlated the recurrent alterations with clinicopathological features and survival of patients. Different subtypes of breast cancer had different patterns of copy number and expression for each PHF. We identified a subset of PHF genes that was recurrently altered with high prevalence, including PYGO2 (pygopus family PHD finger 2), ZMYND8 (zinc finger, MYND-type containing 8), ASXL1 (additional sex combs like 1) and CHD3 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 3). Copy number increase and overexpression of ZMYND8 were more prevalent in Luminal B subtypes and were significantly associated with shorter survival of breast cancer patients. ZMYND8 was also involved in a positive feedback circuit of the estrogen receptor (ER) pathway, and the expression of ZMYND8 was repressed by the bromodomain and extra terminal (BET) inhibitor in breast cancer. Our findings suggest a promising avenue for future research-to focus on a subset of PHFs to better understand the molecular mechanisms and to identify therapeutic targets in breast cancer.	prognostic	1
28055971	Src promotes castration-recurrent prostate cancer through androgen receptor-dependent canonical and non-canonical transcriptional signatures.	Progression of prostate cancer (PC) to castration-recurrent growth (CRPC) remains dependent on sustained expression and transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR). A major mechanism contributing to CRPC progression is through the direct phosphorylation and activation of AR by Src-family (SFK) and ACK1 tyrosine kinases. However, the AR-dependent transcriptional networks activated by Src during CRPC progression have not been elucidated. Here, we show that activated Src (Src527F) induces androgen-independent growth in human LNCaP cells, concomitant with its ability to induce proliferation/survival genes normally induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in androgen-dependent LNCaP and VCaP cells. Src induces additional gene signatures unique to CRPC cell lines, LNCaP-C4-2 and CWR22Rv1, and to CRPC LuCaP35.1 xenografts. By comparing the Src-induced AR-cistrome and/or transcriptome in LNCaP to those in CRPC and LuCaP35.1 tumors, we identified an 11-gene Src-regulated CRPC signature consisting of AR-dependent, AR binding site (ARBS)-associated genes whose expression is altered by DHT in LNCaP[Src527F] but not in LNCaP cells. The differential expression of a subset (DPP4, BCAT1, CNTNAP4, CDH3) correlates with earlier PC metastasis onset and poorer survival, with the expression of BCAT1 required for Src-induced androgen-independent proliferation. Lastly, Src enhances AR binding to non-canonical ARBS enriched for FOXO1, TOP2B and ZNF217 binding motifs; cooperative AR/TOP2B binding to a non-canonical ARBS was both Src- and DHT-sensitive and correlated with increased levels of Src-induced phosphotyrosyl-TOP2B. These data suggest that CRPC progression is facilitated via Src-induced sensitization of AR to intracrine androgen levels, resulting in the engagement of canonical and non-canonical ARBS-dependent gene signatures.

28055970	Genomic analysis of exceptional responders to radiotherapy reveals somatic mutations in ATM.	Radiation therapy is a mainstay of cancer treatment, yet the molecular determinants of clinical response are poorly understood. We identified exceptional responders to radiotherapy based on clinical response, and investigated the associated tumor sequencing data in order to identify additional patients with similar mutations. Among head and neck squamous cell cancer patients receiving palliative radiotherapy at our institution, we identified one patient with documented complete metabolic response. Targeted sequencing analysis of the tumor identified a somatic frame-shift mutation in ATM, a gene known to be associated with radio-sensitivity in the germline. To validate the association of somatic ATM mutation with radiotherapy response, we identified eight patients with ATM truncating mutations who received radiotherapy, all of whom demonstrated excellent responses with a median local control period of 4.62 years. Analysis of 22 DNA repair genes in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data revealed mutations in 15.9% of 9064 tumors across 24 cancer types, with ATM mutations being the most prevalent. This is the first study to suggest that exceptional responses to radiotherapy may be determined by mutations in DNA repair genes. Sequencing of DNA repair genes merits attention in larger cohorts and may have significant implications for the personalization of radiotherapy.	therapeutic	1
28055969	TMPRSS2-ERG fusion promotes prostate cancer metastases in bone.	Bone metastasis is the major deleterious event in prostate cancer (PCa). TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is one of the most common chromosomic rearrangements in PCa. However, its implication in bone metastasis development is still unclear. Since bone metastasis starts with the tropism of cancer cells to bone through specific migratory and invasive processes involving osteomimetic capabilities, it is crucial to better our understanding of the influence of TMPRSS2-ERG expression in the mechanisms underlying the bone tropism properties of PCa cells. We developed bioluminescent cell lines expressing the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in order to assess its role in tumor growth and bone metastasis appearance in a mouse model. First, we showed that the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion increases cell migration and subcutaneous tumor size. Second, using intracardiac injection experiments in mice, we showed that the expression of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion increases the number of metastases in bone. Moreover, TMPRSS2-ERG affects the pattern of metastatic spread by increasing the incidence of tumors in hind limbs and spine, which are two of the most frequent sites of human PCa metastases. Finally, transcriptome analysis highlighted a series of genes regulated by the fusion and involved in the metastatic process. Altogether, our work indicates that TMPRSS2-ERG increases bone tropism of PCa cells and metastasis development.	prognostic	1
28055968	BH3 mimetics suppress CXCL12 expression in human malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells.	Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive, Schwann cell-derived neoplasms of the peripheral nervous system that have recently been shown to possess an autocrine CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling loop that promotes tumor cell proliferation and survival. Importantly, the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis is driven by availability of the CXCL12 ligand rather than CXCR4 receptor levels alone. Therefore, pharmacological reduction of CXCL12 expression could be a potential chemotherapeutic target for patients with MPNSTs or other pathologies wherein the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis is active. AT101 is a well-established BCL-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) mimetic that we recently demonstrated functions as an iron chelator and thus acts as a hypoxia mimetic. In this study, we found that AT101 significantly reduces CXCL12 mRNA and secreted protein in established human MPNST cell lines in vitro. This effect was recapitulated by other BH3 mimetics [ABT-737 (ABT), obatoclax (OBX) and sabutoclax (SBX)] but not by desferrioxamine (DFO), an iron chelator and known hypoxia mimetic. These data suggest that CXCL12 reduction is a function of AT101's BH3 mimetic property rather than its iron chelation ability. Additionally, this study investigates a potential mechanism of BH3 mimetic-mediated CXCL12 suppression: liberation of a negative CXCL12 transcriptional regulator, poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase I (PARP1) from its physical interaction with BCL-2. These data suggest that clinically available BH3 mimetics might prove therapeutically useful at least in part by virtue of their ability to suppress CXCL12 expression.	therapeutic	1
28055967	Cycling hypoxia affects cell invasion and proliferation through direct regulation of claudin1 / claudin7 expression, and indirect regulation of P18 through claudin7.	Claudins (CLDNs), the major integral membrane proteins at tight junction, play critical roles in apical cell-to-cell adhesion, maintenance of epithelial polarity, and formation of impermeable barriers between epithelial cells.We investigated in this study the expression of CLDNs- Claudin1 (CLDN1) and Claudin7 (CLDN7), and their relation to tumor progression in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). CLDN7, rather than CLDN1, showed higher expression in both undifferentiated tumor tissue and the poorly differentiated CNE2 cells, compared with differentiated tissue and the highly differentiated CNE1 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of CLDN7 dramatically inhibited the metastasis and invasion of CNE2 cells suggesting that CLDN7 could act as a biomarker for NPC metastasis.Cycling hypoxia could induce significant changes in CLDN1 and CLDN7 expression in NPC cells. Genetics analysis demonstrated that CLDN1/CLDN7 were not only regulated directly by HIF1a but also affected each other through a feedback mechanism. CLDN7 acted as a bridge to promote HIF1a-induced P18 expression and cell differentiation. Taken together, our results provide evidence that adjusting the oxygenation time and cycles in NPC might be an effective method to prevent / delay the metastasis of poorly differentiated NPC cells.

28055966	Dual inhibition of PCDH9 expression by miR-215-5p up-regulation in gliomas.	The clinical prognosis of malignant gliomas is poor and PCDH9 down-regulation is strongly associated with its poor prognosis. But the mechanism of PCDH9 down-regulation is unknown. Abnormal miRNAs profiles regulate tumor phenotypes through inhibiting their target genes and miRNAs could inhibit target genes more efficiently by binding to both the promoter and 3'UTR of target genes. In this study, to search the dual inhibitory miRNAs which suppress PCDH9 expression in gliomas, we performed an integrative analysis of databases including miRDB, TargetScan, microPIR and miRCancer. We identified three candidate miRNAs which were predicted to bind both the promoter and 3'UTR of PCDH9 and up-regulated in gliomas. Then, we validated miR-215-5p up-regulation and PCDH9 down-regulation in glioma samples and demonstrated that miR-215-5p could inhibit the mRNA and protein levels of PCDH9 in glioma cell lines by targeting its promoter and 3' UTR at the same time. Moreover, miR-215-5p could increase glioma cell proliferation, clone formation, in-vitro migration and reduce apoptosis via inhibiting PCDH9 expression. Our study provides evidence for a novel dual inhibition of PCDH9 by miR-215-5p in gliomas and suggests that miR-215-5p might be a therapeutic target for the treatment of gliomas.	NA	2
28055965	Selected patients can benefit more from the management of etoposide and platinum-based chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation-a retrospective analysis of 707 small cell lung cancer patients.	The management of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has reached a plateau. Etoposide and platinum-based chemotherapy plus thoracic irradiation remain the standard treatment strategy for SCLC. Our study aims to assess the potential prognostic factors of patients treated with etoposide and platinum-based chemotherapy and explore which group of patients can benefit more from standard treatment strategies. On univariate analysis, age&gt;65 years, male patients, KPS (Karnofsky Performance Status)≤80 points, positive smoking history, anemia, lymphocyte counts≤1.65×109/L, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR)&gt;3.18, lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR)≤2.615, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)&gt;216.5 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&gt;119.5 U/L, absence of surgery, absence of thoracic irradiation, chemotherapy cycles&lt;4, metastatic sites≥2 and extensive disease were correlated with a poor prognosis. Gender, KPS, chemotherapy cycles, thoracic irradiation, metastatic sites, LDH and tumor stage held statistical significance on multivariate analysis (p&lt;0.05). High LDH was closely correlated with extensive disease, metastatic sites≥2, anemia, low LMR, high NLR and ALP levels. Subgroup analysis showed patients with male gender, KPS≤80 points, LDH≤216.5U/L, extensive disease and metastatic sites&lt;2 could benefit more from ≥4 chemotherapy cycles. Patients with male gender, KPS&gt;80 points, LDH≤216.5U/L, limited disease and metastatic sites&lt;2 could benefit more from thoracic irradiation (p&lt;0.05 on uni- and multivariate analysis). In conclusion, female patients, KPS&gt;80 points, chemotherapy cycles≥4, thoracic irradiation, metastatic sites&lt;2, LDH≤216.5U/L and limited disease were independent positive prognostic factors for SCLC patients treated with etoposide and platinum-based chemotherapy. Selected patients can benefit more from the management of ≥4 cycles of chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation.	NA	0
28055964	miR-124 represses the mesenchymal features and suppresses metastasis in Ewing sarcoma.	Metastasis is the most powerful predictor of poor outcome of Ewing sarcoma (ES). Thus, identification of new molecules involved in tumor metastasis is of crucial importance to reduce morbidity and mortality of this devastating disease. In this study, we found that miR-124, a highly conserved miRNA, was suppressed in ES tissues and might be associated with tumor metastasis through suppressing its mesenchymal features. Overexpression of miR-124 suppressed the invasion of ES cells in vitro and tumor metastasis in vivo, which might be achieved through suppressing its mesenchymal features, as overexpression of miR-124 could repress the mesenchymal genes expression, and inhibit cell differentiation to mesenchymal lineages in ES cells. However, when SLUG was experimentally restored in these cells, mesenchymal features including suppressed expression of mesenchymal genes and decreased invasive ability were observed. We also found that cyclin D2 (CCND2) was a novel target gene of miR-124, and was directly involved in miR-124-mediated suppressive effects on cell growth. Lastly, we found that treatment with 5-Aza-CdR restored the expression of miR-124, accompanied with suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and mesenchymal features of ES cells, which demonstrated that hypermethylation might be involved in the regulation of miR-124 expression. Collectively, our data suggest that hypermethylation-mediated suppression of miR-124 might be involved in the tumor initiation and metastasis through suppressing the mesenchymal features of ES cells.

28055963	Emetine elicits apoptosis of intractable B-cell lymphoma cells with MYC rearrangement through inhibition of glycolytic metabolism.	Despite improved clinical outcomes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a certain proportion of patients still develop a primary refractory disease. To overcome these lymphomas that are intractable to existing treatment strategies, the tumor microenvironment has been identified as a potential therapeutic target. Here we describe our search for effective drugs for primary refractory lymphoma cells with MYC rearrangement. Through the drug screening of 3,440 known compounds, we identified a unique compound, emetine. This compound was effective against lymphoma cells with MYC rearrangement from two different patients that were co-cultured with cancer associated fibroblasts. Emetine induced the death of these cells with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 312 nM and 506 nM, respectively. Subsequent analyses of the mechanism of action of emetine showed that the drug induced apoptosis of tumor cells via alteration of glucose metabolism through inhibition of hypoxia inducible factor-1α. Moreover, emetine inhibited the potential of cancer associated fibroblasts to support tumor cell viability in vitro and demonstrated significant inhibition of tumor growth in in vivo analyses. Emetine also induced cell death in other primary refractory lymphoma cells with MYC rearrangement. Our combined data indicate that emetine is a potential promising drug for the treatment of intractable lymphomas, which targets both the tumor and its microenvironment.	NA	0
28055960	NA	Hypoxia and extracellular acidosis are pathophysiological hallmarks of aggressive solid tumors. Regulation of intracellular pH (pHi) is essential for the maintenance of tumor cell metabolism and proliferation in this microenvironment and key proteins involved in pHi regulation are of interest for therapeutic development. Carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) is one of the most robustly regulated proteins by the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and contributes to pHi regulation. Here, we have investigated for the first time, the role of CA9 via complete genomic knockout (ko) and compared its impact on tumor cell physiology with the essential pHi regulator Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1). Initially, we established NHE1-ko LS174 cells with inducible CA9 knockdown. While increased sensitivity to acidosis for cell survival in 2-dimensions was not observed, clonogenic proliferation and 3-dimensional spheroid growth in particular were greatly reduced. To avoid potential confounding variables with use of tetracycline-inducible CA9 knockdown, we established CA9-ko and NHE1/CA9-dko cells. NHE1-ko abolished recovery from NH4Cl pre-pulse cellular acid loading while both NHE1 and CA9 knockout reduced resting pHi. NHE1-ko significantly reduced tumor cell proliferation both in normoxia and hypoxia while CA9-ko dramatically reduced growth in hypoxic conditions. Tumor xenografts revealed substantial reductions in tumor growth for both NHE1-ko and CA9-ko. A notable induction of CA12 occurred in NHE1/CA9-dko tumors indicating a potential means to compensate for loss of pH regulating proteins to maintain growth. Overall, these genomic knockout results strengthen the pursuit of targeting tumor cell pH regulation as an effective anti-cancer strategy.	NA	0
28055959	Preoperative low tri-iodothyronine concentration is associated with worse health status and shorter five year survival of primary brain tumor patients.	BACKGROUND: Low tri-iodothyronine syndrome is associated with worse prognosis of severely ill patients. We investigated the association of thyroid hormone levels with discharge outcomes and 5-year mortality in primary brain tumor patients.METHODS: From January, 2010 until September, 2011, 230 patients (70% women) before brain tumor surgery were evaluated for cognitive (Mini mental State Examination; MMSE) and functional (Barthel index; BI) status, and thyroid function profile. The Low triiodothyronine syndrome was defined as triiodothyronine concentration below the reference range. Unfavorable discharge outcomes were Glasgow outcome scale score of ≤3. Follow-up continued until November, 2015.RESULTS: Seventy-four percent of patients had Low triiodothyronine syndrome. Lower total tri-iodothyronine concentrations were associated with lower MMSE (p=.013) and BI (p=.023) scores independent of age, gender and histological diagnosis. Preoperative Low tri-iodothyronine syndrome increased risk for unfavorable discharge outcomes adjusting for age, gender and histological diagnosis (OR=2.944, 95%CI [1.314-6.597], p=.009). In all patients, lower tri-iodothyronine concentrations were associated with greater mortality risk (p≤.038) adjusting for age, gender, extent of resection, adjuvant treatment and histological diagnosis. The Low tri-iodothyronine syndrome was associated with greater 5-year mortality for glioma patients (HR=2.197; 95%CI [1.160-4.163], p=.016) and with shorter survival (249 [260] vs. 352 [399] days; p=.029) of high grade glioma patients independent of age, gender, extent of resection and adjuvant treatment.CONCLUSIONS: The Low tri-iodothyronine syndrome is common in brain tumor patients and is associated with poor functional and cognitive status, and with worse discharge outcomes. The Low tri-iodothyronine syndrome is associated with shorter survival of glioma patients.	NA	0
28055957	Analysis of molecular mechanisms of 5-fluorouracil-induced steatosis and inflammation in vitro and in mice.	Chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis is attracting increasing attention because it heralds an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing surgery because of liver metastases. The aim of this study was to develop in vitro and in vivo models to analyze the pathogenesis of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced steatohepatitis.Therefore, primary human hepatocytes and HepG2 hepatoma cells were incubated with 5-FU at non-toxic concentrations up to 24 h. Furthermore, hepatic tissue of C57BL/6N mice was analyzed 24 h after application of a single 5-FU dose (200 mg/kg body weight). In vitro, incubation with 5-FU induced a significant increase of hepatocellular triglyceride levels. This was paralleled by an impairment of mitochondrial function and a dose- and time-dependently increased expression of fatty acid acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), which catalyzes the initial step for peroxisomal β-oxidation. The latter is known to generate reactive oxygen species, and consequently, expression of the antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) was significantly upregulated in 5-FU-treated cells, indicative for oxidative stress. Furthermore, 5-FU significantly induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes IL-8 and ICAM-1. Also in vivo, 5-FU significantly induced hepatic ACOX1 and HMOX1 expression as well as JNK-activation, pro-inflammatory gene expression and immune cell infiltration. In summary, we identified molecular mechanisms by which 5-FU induces hepatocellular lipid accumulation and inflammation. Our newly developed models can be used to gain further insight into the pathogenesis of 5-FU-induced steatohepatitis and to develop therapeutic strategies to inhibit its development and progression.

28055956	Circulating exosomal microRNAs as prognostic biomarkers for non-small-cell lung cancer.	Exosomal miRNAs are proposed as excellent candidate biomarkers for clinical applications. However, little is known about their potential roles as prognostic biomarkers in lung cancer. In this study, we explored the prognostic value of plasma exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) array panel, we analyzed 84 plasma exosomal miRNAs in 10 lung adenocarcinoma patients and 10 matched healthy controls. The qPCR array showed 30 aberrantly expressed exosomal miRNAs. Nine candidate miRNAs were selected based on differential expression and previous reports for further evaluating their prognostic roles in 196 NSCLC patients. Elevated levels of exosomal miR-23b-3p, miR-10b-5p and miR-21-5p were independently associated with poor overall survival (with hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 2.42 (1.45 - 4.04), P = 0.001; 2.22 (1.18 - 4.16), P = 0.013; 2.12 (1.28 - 3.49), P = 0.003, respectively). When compared to the clinical prognostic variables only model, adding the three exosomal miRNA signatures significantly improved survival predictive accuracy with an increase of time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.88 to 0.91 (P=0.015). Our results indicated that plasma exosomal miR-23b-3p, miR-10b-5p and miR-21-5p are promising non-invasive prognostic biomarkers of NSCLC.	NA	2
28055955	Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T Cells inhibit the growth and metastases of established tissue factor-positive tumors in NOG mice.	Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cell (CAR T) is a promising therapeutic option for patients with cancer. Such an approach requires the identification of tumor-specific antigen targets that are expressed in solid tumors. We developed a new third-generation CAR directed against tissue factor (TF), a surface molecule overexpressed in some types of lung cancer, melanoma and other cancers. First, we demonstrated by immunohistochemistry that TF was overexpressed in squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma using a human tissue microarray. In the presence of TF-positive cancer cells, the CAR-modified T cells (TF-CAR T) were highly activated and showed specific cytotoxicity to TF-positive cancer cells in vitro. In established s.c. xenograft and lung metastasis models, TF-CAR T cells could significantly suppress the growth of s.c. xenograft and metastasis of TF-positive cancer cells. Additionally, the safety evaluation of TF-CAR T cells in vivo showed that the treatment did not cause obvious toxicity in mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that TF-CAR T cells might be a novel potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with TF-positive cancers.	NA	0
28053292	Randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety of one-year administration of green tea catechins.	PURPOSE: Although preclinical, epidemiological and prior clinical trial data suggest that green tea catechins (GTCs) may reduce prostate cancer (PCa) risk, several preclinical studies and case reports have reported liver toxicities and acute gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on these observations, regulatory bodies have required stringent inclusion criteria with frequent, excessive toxicity monitoring and early stopping rules in clinical trials. These requirements have impeded recruitment and retention of subjects in chemoprevention trials and subsequent progress in agent development efforts.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of Polyphenon E® (PolyE®), a proprietary mixture of decaffeinated GTCs, containing 400 mg (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) per day, in 97 men with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and/or atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP). PolyE® containing 200 mg EGCG was administered with food, BID. A secondary study endpoint in this trial was a comparison of the overall one-year treatment related adverse events and grade 3 or higher adverse event on the two study arms. Monthly assessments of toxicity (CTCAE 4.0), concomitant medications and organ function, including hepatic panel, PT/PTT and LDH, were performed.RESULTS: Daily intake of a standardized, decaffeinated, catechin mixture containing 200 mg EGCG BID taken with food for 1 year accumulated in plasma and was well tolerated and did not produce treatment related adverse effects in men with baseline HGPIN or ASAP.CONCLUSION: The current data provides evidence of safety of decaffeinated, catechin mixture containing 200 mg EGCG BID to be further tested for prostate cancer prevention or other indications.

28053291	SPARC expression in gastric cancer predicts poor prognosis: Results from a clinical cohort, pooled analysis and GSEA assay.	BACKGROUND: The prognostic role of Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC) in gastric cancer (GC) remains controversial. We investigated the clinical significance, the survival relevance, and potential function of SPARC in GC with resected samples, online gene set GSE62254, and cell line SGC7901.RESULTS: High immunostaining of SPARC significantly correlated with tumor differentiation (P = 0.004), and independently predicted shorter overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.446, P = 0.022), based on the current IHC evaluation. The accuracy of the results was further validated with 1000 times bootstrapping and the time-dependent receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curves. The meta-analysis (pooled HR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.01-2.53) confirmed SPARC as the predictor for reduced OS in GC. Moreover, the association between enhanced SPARC expression and Adriamycin (Adr) sensitivity was revealed by GSEA, and then confirmed by comparative cellular experiments, such as the protein level analysis of SGC7901and SGC7901/Adr cell line.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) method was used to detect SPARC expression in 137 GC cases. Meta-analysis was performed based on 5 studies published in English on PubMed up to March 2016. GSEA was performed using online data set GSE62254 and GC-related functional gene sets derived from molecular signatures database (MSigDB). Western Blot was carried out to compare protein-level differences between gastric carcinoma SGC7901 cell line and Adr resistant SGC7901/Adr cell line. MTT assay was done to confirm the induction of SPARC on Adr sensitivity.CONCLUSIONS: Increased SPARC expression in GC led to a worse clinical outcome of patients and might induce Adr sensitivity of GC cells.	prognostic	1

28053288	Clinicopathological significance of SMAD4 loss in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality. Although advances have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of PDAC, the outcome still remains poor. The aim of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the precise association between SMAD4 loss and clinicopathological significance in PDAC. A literature search was made in PubMed, Web of Science, Google scholar, and EMBASE for related publications. The data were extracted and assessed by two reviewers independently. Analysis of pooled data was performed, Odds Ratio or Hazard Ratio with corresponding confidence intervals was calculated and summarized. 12 relevant articles were included for full review in detail and meta-analysis. The frequency of SMAD4 protein loss was significantly increased in PDAC than in nonmalignant pancreatic tissue, Odd Ratio was 0.05 with 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.23, p&lt;0.0001. SMAD4 loss was significantly associated with poor overall survival in patients with PDAC, Hazard Ratio was 0.61 with 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.99, p=0.05. SMAD4 loss was not correlated with the size, grades, and lymph node metastasis of PDAC. In conclusion, SMAD4 is a biomarker for the diagnosis of PDAC. SMAD4 loss is significantly related to poor prognosis in patients with PDAC.	prognostic	1

INTRODUCTION: Bevacizumab addiction to triplet chemotherapy, according to FIr-B/FOx schedule, as first-line treatment in young-elderly metastatic colorectal CANCER (MCRC) patients may be more effective. Tailored treatments show worse clinical outcome in unfit patients.METHODS: Elderly patients were clinically evaluated according to age and comorbidity (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale) to select FIr-B/FOx regimen in fit or tailored treatments in unfit elderly. Limiting toxicity syndromes (LTS) were evaluated.RESULTS: At 17 months follow-up, in 28 young-elderly patients treated with first line FIr-B/FOx: objective response rate (ORR) 79%, progression-free survival (PFS) 11 months, overall survival (OS) 21 months. Clinical outcome was not significantly different according to KRAS genotype. G3-4 toxicities were diarrhea 21%, mucositis 11%, neutropenia 11%. LTS were 46%, significantly more multiple than single site. At 8 months follow-up, in 37 unfit patients: ORR 37%, PFS 7 months, OS 13 months. PFS was significantly different in KRAS wild-type compared to mutant patients, while not OS. PFS and OS were significantly worse in KRAS c.35 G &gt; A compared to wild-type and/or other mutant.CONCLUSIONS: Careful decision-making process including evaluation of patient's fitness, and individual safety should be included to select FIr-B/FOx intensive first line regimen in young-elderly MCRC patients. KRAS, and specifically c.35 G &gt; A mutant genotype, may significantly affect clinical outcome in patients unfit for FIr-B/FOx.	prognostic	1
28053286	Autophagy defection in fibroblast-like synoviocytes lead to immune enhancement potential in rheumatoid arthritis.	The incidence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been reported to be correlated with a disorder of immunregulation. Rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) play an important role in regulating the local immune microenvironment. However, the potential mechanism of RA-FLS in regulating the immnue response is not clearly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of HIF-1α was significantly up-regulated in rheumatoid arthritis tissue which indicated that the hypoxia condition in the microenvironment. We also observed that RA-FLSs demonstrated the potential to up-regulate immune activation. Meanwhile, the level of autophagy increased in RA-FLSs compared with control group. Besides that, the expression of IL-6 was up-regulated not only in RA-FLSs but also in the fibroblasts that treated with hypoxia condition. Accordingly, we found that autophagy inhibitiors could effectively inhibit the immune activation function of RA-FLSs medicated by IL-6. Taken together, the results we demonstrated above indicated that the hypoxia microenvironment could effectively induce the incidence of autophagy and then lead to the immune activation function of RA-FLSs medicated by IL-6.

28056099	Integrated Analysis of Genome-Wide Copy Number Alterations and Gene Expression Profiling of Lung Cancer in Xuanwei, China.	OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer in Xuanwei (LCXW), China, is known throughout the world for its distinctive characteristics, but little is known about its pathogenesis. The purpose of this study was to screen potential novel &quot;driver genes&quot; in LCXW.METHODS: Genome-wide DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) were detected by array-based comparative genomic hybridization and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by gene expression microarrays in 8 paired LCXW and non-cancerous lung tissues. Candidate driver genes were screened by integrated analysis of CNAs and DEGs. The candidate genes were further validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: Large numbers of CNAs and DEGs were detected, respectively. Some of the most frequently occurring CNAs included gains at 5p15.33-p15.32, 5p15.1-p14.3, and 5p14.3-p14.2 and losses at 11q24.3, 21q21.1, 21q22.12-q22.13, and 21q22.2. Integrated analysis of CNAs and DEGs identified 24 candidate genes with frequent copy number gains and concordant upregulation, which were considered potential oncogenes, including CREB3L4, TRIP13, and CCNE2. In addition, the analysis identified 19 candidate genes with a negative association between copy number change and expression change, considered potential tumor suppressor genes, including AHRR, NKD2, and KLF10. One of the most studied oncogenes, MYC, may not play a carcinogenic role in LCXW.CONCLUSIONS: This integrated analysis of CNAs and DEGs identified several potential novel LCXW-related genes, laying an important foundation for further research on the pathogenesis of LCXW and identification of novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets.

28056089	Helicobacter Pylori Promote B7-H1 Expression by Suppressing miR-152 and miR-200b in Gastric Cancer Cells.	The most common cause of gastric cancer is infection with helicobacter pylori (HP), but the associated molecular mechanism is not well understood. In the present study, we found a marked increase in the expression of B7-H1, a member of the B7 co-stimulatory family of molecules that bind to programmed death-1 (PD-1) and play a critical immunoregulatory role in the cell-mediated immune response, in HP-positive gastric cancer tissue. Infection of cultured gastric cancer cells with HP promoted B7-H1 expression and inhibited miR-152 and miR-200b expression. We further demonstrated that these two miRNAs targeted B7-H1 mRNA and suppressed B7-H1 expression in gastric cancer cells. Finally, B7-H1 expression was found to correlate with miR-152 and miR-200b levels in gastric tumor tissues from human patients. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which HP infection promotes gastric cancer and also suggest potential targets, i.e., miR-152 and miR-200b, for the prevention and treatment of gastric cancer.

28056055	HDAC and Proteasome Inhibitors Synergize to Activate Pro-Apoptotic Factors in Synovial Sarcoma.	Conventional cytotoxic therapies for synovial sarcoma provide limited benefit, and no drugs specifically targeting its driving SS18-SSX fusion oncoprotein are currently available. Patients remain at high risk for early and late metastasis. A high-throughput drug screen consisting of over 900 tool compounds and epigenetic modifiers, representing over 100 drug classes, was undertaken in a panel of synovial sarcoma cell lines to uncover novel sensitizing agents and targetable pathways. Top scoring drug categories were found to be HDAC inhibitors and proteasomal targeting agents. We find that the HDAC inhibitor quisinostat disrupts the SS18-SSX driving protein complex, thereby reestablishing expression of EGR1 and CDKN2A tumor suppressors. In combination with proteasome inhibition, HDAC inhibitors synergize to decrease cell viability and elicit apoptosis. Quisinostat inhibits aggresome formation in response to proteasome inhibition, and combination treatment leads to elevated endoplasmic reticulum stress, activation of pro-apoptotic effector proteins BIM and BIK, phosphorylation of BCL-2, increased levels of reactive oxygen species, and suppression of tumor growth in a murine model of synovial sarcoma. This study identifies and provides mechanistic support for a particular susceptibility of synovial sarcoma to the combination of quisinostat and proteasome inhibition.	NA	0
28056026	Integration of MicroRNA, mRNA, and Protein Expression Data for the Identification of Cancer-Related MicroRNAs.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are responsible for the regulation of target genes involved in various biological processes, and may play oncogenic or tumor suppressive roles. Many studies have investigated the relationships between miRNAs and their target genes, using mRNA and miRNA expression data. However, mRNA expression levels do not necessarily represent the exact gene expression profiles, since protein translation may be regulated in several different ways. Despite this, large-scale protein expression data have been integrated rarely when predicting gene-miRNA relationships. This study explores two approaches for the investigation of gene-miRNA relationships by integrating mRNA expression and protein expression data. First, miRNAs were ranked according to their effects on cancer development. We calculated influence scores for each miRNA, based on the number of significant mRNA-miRNA and protein-miRNA correlations. Furthermore, we constructed modules containing mRNAs, proteins, and miRNAs, in which these three molecular types are highly correlated. The regulatory interactions between miRNA and genes in these modules have been validated based on the direct regulations, indirect regulations, and co-regulations through transcription factors. We applied our approaches to glioblastomas (GBMs), ranked miRNAs depending on their effects on GBM, and obtained 52 GBM-related modules. Compared with the miRNA rankings and modules constructed using only mRNA expression data, the rankings and modules constructed using mRNA and protein expression data were shown to have better performance. Additionally, we experimentally verified that miR-504, highly ranked and included in the identified modules, plays a suppressive role in GBM development. We demonstrated that the integration of both expression profiles allows a more precise analysis of gene-miRNA interactions and the identification of a higher number of cancer-related miRNAs and regulatory mechanisms.

28056465	The impact of age on complications, survival, and cause of death following colon cancer surgery.	BACKGROUND: Given scarce data regarding the relationship among age, complications, and survival beyond the 30-day postoperative period for oncology patients in the United States, this study identified age-related differences in complications and the rate and cause of 1-year mortality following colon cancer surgery.METHODS: The NY State Cancer Registry and Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System identified stage I-III colon cancer resections (2004-2011). Multivariable logistic regression and survival analyses assessed the relationship among age (&lt;65, 65-74, ⩾75), complications, 1-year survival, and cause of death.RESULTS: Among 24 426 patients surviving &gt;30 days, 1-year mortality was 8.5%. Older age groups had higher complication rates, and older age and complications were independently associated with 1-year mortality (P&lt;0.0001). Increasing age was associated with a decrease in the proportion of deaths from colon cancer with a concomitant increase in the proportion of deaths from cardiovascular disease. Older age and sepsis were independently associated with higher risk of colon cancer-specific death (65-74: HR=1.59, 95% CI=1.26-2.00; ⩾75: HR=2.57, 95% CI=2.09-3.16; sepsis: HR=2.58, 95% CI=2.13-3.11) and cardiovascular disease-specific death (65-74: HR=3.72, 95% CI=2.29-6.05; ⩾75: HR=7.02, 95% CI=4.44-11.10; sepsis: HR=2.33, 95% CI=1.81-2.99).CONCLUSIONS: Older age and sepsis are associated with higher 1-year overall, cancer-specific, and cardiovascular-specific mortality, highlighting the importance of geriatric assessment, multidisciplinary care, and cardiovascular optimisation for older patients and those with infectious complications.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 5 January 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2016.421 www.bjcancer.com.

28056464	Impact of CTLA-4 blockade in conjunction with metronomic chemotherapy on preclinical breast cancer growth.	BACKGROUND: Although there are reports that metronomic cyclophosphamide (CTX) can be immune stimulating, the impact of its combination with anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer remains to be evaluated.METHODS: Murine EMT-6/P breast cancer, or its cisplatin or CTX-resistant variants, or CT-26 colon, were implanted into Balb/c mice. Established tumours were monitored for relative growth following treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody alone or in combination with; (a) metronomic CTX (ldCTX; 20 mg kg(-1) day(-1)), b) bolus (150 mg kg(-1)) plus ldCTX, or (c) sequential treatment with gemcitabine (160 mg kg(-1) every 3 days).RESULTS: EMT-6/P tumours responded to anti-CTLA-4 therapy, but this response was less effective when combined with bolus plus ldCTX. Anti-CTLA-4 could be effectively combined with either ldCTX (without a bolus), or with regimens of either sequential or concomitant gemcitabine, including in orthotopic EMT-6 tumours, and independently of the schedule of drug administration. Tumour responses were confirmed with CT-26 tumours but were less pronounced in drug-resistant EMT-6/CTX or EMT-6/DDP tumour models than in the parent tumour. A number of tumour bearing mice developed spontaneous metastases under continuous therapy. The majority of cured mice rejected tumour re-challenges.CONCLUSIONS: Metronomic CTX can be combined with anti-CTLA-4 therapy, but this therapy is impaired by concomitant bolus CTX. Sequential therapy of anti-CTLA-4 followed by gemcitabine is effective in chemotherapy-naive tumours, although tumour relapses can occur, in some cases accompanied by the development of spontaneous metastases.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 5 January 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2016.429 www.bjcancer.com.

28056463	Soluble VE-cadherin in metastatic breast cancer: an independent prognostic factor for both progression-free survival and overall survival.	BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) represent a heterogeneous group, with large differences in outcomes from individual patients. VE-cadherin, an endothelial-specific cadherin, was shown to promote tumour proliferation and angiogenesis. Soluble VE-cadherin has been recently associated to breast cancer progression. This study was designed to investigate the prognosis significance of soluble VE-cadherin in hormone-refractory MBC.METHODS: Between 2004 and 2007, 150 patients with a fully documented history of hormone-refractory MBC were included in the prospective SEMTOF study. Serum concentrations of VE-cadherin were measured at inclusion for 141 patients and 6 weeks after the beginning of chemotherapy, using a sandwich enzyme immunoassay.RESULTS: The presence of high levels of serum VE-cadherin was significantly correlated to a shorter progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In a multivariate analysis along with clinical and biologic prognostic parameters, high serum VE-cadherin level was an independent adverse prognostic variable for PFS (median PFS 9.7 (IC95: 8; 11.9) vs 5.8 (IC95: 4.1; 8) months P=0.0008) and OS (median OS 34 (IC95: 26.6; 47.1) vs 14.8 (IC95: 9.3; 21.4) months P=0.0007). Moreover, VE-cadherin decrease during chemotherapy was also associated with good prognosis.CONCLUSIONS: Serum VE-cadherin levels correlate to poorer survival in patients with hormone-refractory MBC. As sVE-cadherin reflects tumour angiogenesis, this could have therapeutic implications for antiangiogenic treatment.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 5 January 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2016.427 www.bjcancer.com.

28053325	Effects of miRNA-15 and miRNA-16 expression replacement in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Implication for therapy.	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) clones are characterized by loss of a critical region in 13q14.3, [del(13)(q14)] involving the microRNA (miRNA) cluster miR-15a and miR-16-1. We have investigated the effects of replacement of miR-15a and miR-16-1. CLL cells transfected with these miRNA mimics exhibited a decrease in cell viability in vitro and impaired capacity for engraftment and growth in NOD/Shi-scid,γcnull (NSG) mice. No synergistic effects were observed when the two miRNA mimics were combined. The phenomena were not restricted to CLL with the del(13)(q14) lesion. Similar effects induced by miRNA mimics were seen in cells with additional chromosomal abnormalities with the exception of certain CLL clones harboring TP53 alterations. Administration of miRNA mimics to NSG mice previously engrafted with CLL clones resulted in substantial tumor regression. CLL cell transfection with miR-15a and miR-16-1 specific inhibitors resulted in increased cell viability in vitro and in an enhanced capacity of the engrafted cells to grow in NSG mice generating larger splenic nodules. These data demonstrate that the strong control by miR-15a and miR-16-1 on CLL clonal expansion is exerted also at the level of full-blown leukemia and provide indications for a miRNA based therapeutic strategy.Leukemia accepted article preview online, 05 January 2017. doi:10.1038/leu.2016.394.

28054353	Factors related to pregnancy and birth and the risk of childhood brain tumours: The ESTELLE and ESCALE studies (SFCE, France).	Little is known of the causes of childhood brain tumors (CBT). The aims of this study were to investigate whether extremes of birth weight were associated with increased risk of CBT and whether maternal pre-conceptional folic acid supplementation or breastfeeding reduced the risk. In addition, other maternal characteristics and birth related factors were also investigated. We pooled data from two French national population-based case-control studies with similar designs conducted in 2003-2004 and 2010-2011. The mothers of 510 CBT cases (directly recruited from the national childhood cancer register) and 3102 controls aged under 15 years, frequency matched by age and gender did a telephone interview, which focussed on demographic and perinatal characteristics, and maternal life style habits and reproductive history. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, study of origin and relevant confounders. No association was found between CBT and birth weight or fetal growth. The use of pre-conceptional folic acid supplementation was rare (5.3% in cases and 7.8% in controls) and the OR was 0.8 (95% CI 0.5, 1.4). There was no association with breastfeeding, even prolonged (six months or more) (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.8, 1.4). Neither was there any association between CBT and other investigated factors (maternal body mass index, gestational weight gain, congenital abnormality, maternal reproductive history or use of fertility treatments. Although large, this study was underpowered for subtype analyses. Pooling data with other population-based studies may provide further insight into findings by CBT subtypes.

28056426	Association between the diagnosis-to-treatment interval and overall survival in Taiwanese patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between the diagnosis-to-treatment interval (DTI) and overall survival (OS) in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).METHODS: A total of 18,677 patients with first primary OSCC identified in the Taiwanese Cancer Registry Database between 2004 and 2010 were examined. The effect of DTI on 5-year OS rates was investigated with multivariate Cox regression analysis. After the identification of the optimal cutoff for DTI based on the 5-year OS rates, DTI was classified in the following 20-day groups: ≤20 days (57% of the study patients), 21-45 days (34%), 46-90 days (6%) and ≥91 days (3%). In additional exploratory analyses, DTI was reclassified in the following 30-day interval groups: ≤30 days (81% of the study patients), 31-60 days (14%), 61-90 days (2%) and ≥91 days (3%).RESULTS: Multivariate analyses identified DTI (≤20 days versus other subgroups), sex (female versus male), age (&lt;65 versus ≥65 years), clinical stage (p-stage I versus p-stage II, III, IV) and treatment modality (initial surgery versus initial non-surgery) as independent prognostic factors for 5-year OS. Compared with a DTI ≤20 days, the DTI categories ≥91 days (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.28, P &lt; 0.001), 46-90 days (HR: 1.25, P &lt; 0.001) and 21-45 days (HR: 1.07, P = 0.007) were independently associated with a higher risk of 5-year mortality. Similar results were obtained for DTI ≤30 days groups.CONCLUSIONS: DTI is independently associated with 5-year OS in OSCC patients. A DTI longer than 30 days or even 20 days may potentially decrease survival.	NA	0
28052933	Grilled, Barbecued, and Smoked Meat Intake and Survival Following Breast Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Grilled, barbecued, and smoked meat intake, a prevalent dietary source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) carcinogens, may increase the risk of incident breast cancer. However, no studies have examined whether intake of this PAH source influences survival after breast cancer.METHODS: We interviewed a population-based cohort of 1508 women diagnosed with first primary invasive or in situ breast cancer in 1996 and 1997 at baseline and again approximately five years later to assess grilled/barbecued and smoked meat intake. After a median of 17.6 years of follow-up, 597 deaths, of which 237 were breast cancer related, were identified. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality as related to prediagnosis intake, comparing high (above the median) to low intake, as well as postdiagnosis changes in intake, comparing every combination of pre-/postdiagnosis intake to low pre-/postdiagnosis intake. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: High prediagnosis grilled/barbecued and smoked meat intake was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.46). Other associations were noted, but estimates were not statistically significant. These include high prediagnosis smoked beef/lamb/pork intake and increased all-cause (HR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.99 to 1.38, Ptrend = .10) and breast cancer-specific (HR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.95 to 1.60, Ptrend = .09) mortality. Also, among women with continued high grilled/barbecued and smoked meat intake after diagnosis, all-cause mortality risk was elevated 31% (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 0.96 to 1.78). Further, breast cancer-specific mortality was decreased among women with any pre- and postdiagnosis intake of smoked poultry/fish (HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.31 to 0.97).CONCLUSION: High intake of grilled/barbecued and smoked meat may increase mortality after breast cancer.

28052770	A systematic search strategy identifies cubilin as independent prognostic marker for renal cell carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: There is an unmet clinical need for better prognostic and diagnostic tools for renal cell carcinoma (RCC).METHODS: Human Protein Atlas data resources, including the transcriptomes and proteomes of normal and malignant human tissues, were searched for RCC-specific proteins and cubilin (CUBN) identified as a candidate. Patient tissue representing various cancer types was constructed into a tissue microarray (n = 940) and immunohistochemistry used to investigate the specificity of CUBN expression in RCC as compared to other cancers. Two independent RCC cohorts (n = 181; n = 114) were analyzed to further establish the sensitivity of CUBN as RCC-specific marker and to explore if the fraction of RCCs lacking CUBN expression could predict differences in patient survival.RESULTS: CUBN was identified as highly RCC-specific protein with 58% of all primary RCCs staining positive for CUBN using immunohistochemistry. In venous tumor thrombi and metastatic lesions, the frequency of CUBN expression was increasingly lost. Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) patients with CUBN positive tumors had a significantly better prognosis compared to patients with CUBN negative tumors, independent of T-stage, Fuhrman grade and nodal status (HR 0.382, CI 0.203-0.719, P = 0.003).CONCLUSIONS: CUBN expression is highly specific to RCC and loss of the protein is significantly and independently associated with poor prognosis. CUBN expression in ccRCC provides a promising positive prognostic indicator for patients with ccRCC. The high specificity of CUBN expression in RCC also suggests a role as a new diagnostic marker in clinical cancer differential diagnostics to confirm or rule out RCC.	diagnostic	1
28052766	Biopsy of breast cancer metastases: patient characteristics and survival.	BACKGROUND: Discordance in hormone receptors (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status between primary tumors and metastatic sites for breast cancer is well established. However, it is uncertain which patient-related factors lead to biopsy when metastases are suspected and whether having a biopsy impacts survival.METHODS: The medical charts of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients diagnosed January 2000-August 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. A biopsy was defined as a procedure where tissue was obtained and assessed for both HR and HER2. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess patient characteristics related to biopsy and whether having a biopsy was associated with improved survival.RESULTS: Of 409 patients suspected of having MBC, 165 (40%) had a biopsy, and 34% of these had discordant HR or HER2 status when compared to the initial diagnosis. In multivariate analysis, having a biopsy was associated with: recurrence in years 2010-2014, disease-free interval of &gt; =3 years, stage 0-IIA at presentation, suspected locoregional recurrence, being HR+/HER2-, or missing HR/HER2 at diagnosis. A similar multivariate analysis revealed that having a biopsy was associated with improved survival (HR = 0.67, p = 0.002). The association of biopsy and improved survival was noted in specific subgroups: patients with missing HR and HER2 data at initial diagnosis (p = 0.001), those without metastases in liver, lung or brain (p = 0.001), and being younger than 70 years old at recurrence (p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Specific clinical factors were associated with biopsy at the time of suspected recurrence. Having a biopsy was associated with reduced mortality.	NA	0
28052758	Prognostic values of EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HCC18 index-scores in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma - clinical application of health-related quality-of-life data.	BACKGROUND: Health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) assessment with EORTC QLQ-C30 was prognostic for overall survival (OS) in patients with advance-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but no data existed for early-stage patients. The HCC-specific QLQ-HCC18 has not been evaluated for prognostic value in HCC patients. Utilization of raw HRQOL data in clinical setting has been impractical and non-meaningful. Therefore we developed index scores of QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HCC18 in an attempt to enable clinical utilization of these HRQOL measurements. This study investigates the prognostic significance of QLQ-C30, QLQ-HCC18 and C30/HCC18 index-scores in patients with newly diagnosed HCC which encompasses all stages.METHODS: From 2007-2011, 517 patients were prospectively recruited. HRQOL was assessed at diagnosis using QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HCC18; C30 and HCC18 index-scores were calculated from raw HRQOL data. Cox regression was performed using continuous, dichotomized QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HCC18 variables, or index-scores, together with clinical factors to identify independent factors for OS. Various multivariate models were validated with c-index and bootstrapping for 1000 replications.RESULTS: Four hundred and seventy two patients had complete HRQOL data. Their median OS was 8.6 months. In multivariate analysis, independent prognostic HRQOL variables for OS were QLQ-C30 pain (HR 1.346 [1.092-1.661], p = 0.0055), QLQ-C30 physical functioning (HR 0.652 [0.495-0.860], p = 0.0024); QLQ-HCC18 pain (HR 1.382 [1.089-1.754], p = 0.0077) and QLQ-HCC18 fatigue (HR 1.441 [1.132-1.833], p = 0.0030). C30 index-score (HR 2.143 [1.616-2.841], p &lt; 0.0001) and HCC18 index-score (HR 1.957 [1.411-2.715], p &lt; 0.0001) were highly significant factors for OS. The median OS of patients with C30 index-score of 0-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-100 were 16.4, 7.3, 3.1, 1.8 months respectively (p &lt; 0.0001); while for HCC18 index-score: 16.4, 6.0, 2.8, 1.8 months respectively (p &lt; 0.0001). All the multivariate models were validated, with mean optimism &lt;0.01. The bootstrap validated c-index was 0.78.CONCLUSIONS: QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HCC18 were prognostic for OS in patients with newly diagnosed HCC irrespective of stage. Both C30 and HCC18 index-scores were highly significant prognostic factors for OS in newly diagnosed HCC patients. Index-scoring provides an effective way to summarize, analyze and interpret raw HRQOL data, and renders QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HCC18 meaningful and communicable in clinical practice. Index-scores could potentially serve as a standardized tool for future HRQOL research.	NA	0
28056167	Filter paper-assisted cell transfer (FaCT) technique: A novel cell-sampling technique for intraoperative diagnosis of central nervous system tumors.	BACKGROUND: Intraoperative diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) tumors provides critical guidance to surgeons in the determination of surgical resection margins and treatment. The techniques and preparations used for the intraoperative diagnosis of CNS tumors include frozen sectioning and cytologic methods (squash smear and touch imprint). Cytologic specimens, which do not have freezing artifacts, are important as an adjuvant tool to frozen sections. However, if the amount of submitted tissue samples is limited, then it is difficult to prepare both frozen sections and squash smears or touch imprint specimens from a single sample at the same time. Therefore, the objective of this study was to derive cells directly from filter paper on which tumor samples are placed.METHODS: The authors established the filter paper-assisted cell transfer (FaCT) smear technique, in which tumor cells are transferred onto a glass slide directly from the filter paper sample spot after the biopsy is removed.RESULTS: Cell yields and diagnostic accuracy of the FaCT smears were assessed in 40 CNS tumors. FaCT smears had ample cell numbers and well preserved cell morphology sufficient for cytologic diagnosis, even if the submitted tissues were minimal. The overall diagnostic concordance rates between frozen sections and FaCT smears were 90% and 87.5%, respectively (no significant differences). When combining FaCT smears with frozen sections, the diagnostic concordance rate rose to 92.5%.CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that the FaCT smear technique is a simple and effective processing method that has significant value for intraoperative diagnosis of CNS tumors.

28055120	Evaluation of proposed staging systems for human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) have improved survival when compared with those with HPV-negative OPC. Unfortunately, the American Joint Committee on Cancer seventh edition (AJCC-7ed) staging system does not account for the prognostic advantage observed with HPV-positive OPC. The purpose of the current study was to validate and compare 2 recently proposed staging systems for HPV-positive OPC.METHODS: Patients treated for HPV-positive OPC from 2005 to 2015 at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) were included for analysis. The International Collaboration on Oropharyngeal cancer Network for Staging (ICON-S) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) staging systems were applied and survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to determine the relationship between stage of disease and survival. Models were compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC).RESULTS: A total of 435 patients were eligible for analysis. There was a dramatic shift in lymph node category and overall stage of disease when ICON-S and MDACC stage were applied to the JHH cohort. There was superior stratification of overall survival and progression-free survival by ICON-S stage. Both proposed models had an improved fit based on AIC scores (P&lt;.001 for both) over the AJCC-7ed. The ICON-S staging system had the lowest AIC score, and thus a better fit within the JHH population.CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis provides external validation for both staging systems in an independent and heterogeneously treated patient population. Although the MDACC staging system is an improvement over the AJCC-7ed, the ICON-S stage provides superior stratification of overall and progression-free survival, thereby supporting its use as the updated AJCC staging system for OPC.

28055119	A pilot randomized controlled trial of cognitive bias modification to reduce fear of breast cancer recurrence.	BACKGROUND: The most common, persistent concern among survivors of breast cancer is the fear that their disease will return, yet to the authors' knowledge, few interventions targeting fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) have been developed to date. The current pilot study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a home-delivered cognitive bias modification intervention to reduce FCR. The intervention, called Attention and Interpretation Modification for Fear of Breast Cancer Recurrence (AIM-FBCR), targeted 2 types of cognitive biases (ie, attention and interpretation biases).METHODS: A total of 110 survivors of breast cancer were randomized to receive 8 sessions of 1 of 2 versions of AIM-FBCR or a control condition program. Computer-based assessments of cognitive biases and a self-report measure of FCR were administered before the intervention, after the intervention, and 3 months after the intervention.RESULTS: Improvements in health worries (P = .019) and interpretation biases (rates of threat endorsement [P&lt;.001] and reaction times for threat rejection [P = .007]) were found in those survivors who received AIM-FBCR compared with the control arm. Although only 26% of participants who screened into the study agreed to participate, the trial otherwise appeared feasible and acceptable, with 83% of those who initiated the intervention completing at least 5 of 8 sessions, and 90% reporting satisfaction with the computer-based program used.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current pilot study suggest the promise of AIM-FBCR in reducing FCR in survivors of breast cancer. Future research should attempt to replicate these findings in a larger-scale trial using a more sophisticated, user-friendly program and additional measures of improvement in more diverse samples.

28055110	Survivorship after lower gastrointestinal cancer: Patient-reported outcomes and planning for care.	BACKGROUND: There is significant need for quality follow-up care to optimize long-term outcomes for the growing population of lower gastrointestinal (GI) cancer survivors. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) provide valuable information regarding late and long-term effects (LLTEs).METHODS: A convenience sample from 1129 colon, rectal, and anal cancer survivors (n = 792; 218, and 119, respectively) who participated in an Internet-based survivorship care plan (SCP) tool between May 2010 and October 2014 was used to examine patient-reported demographics, treatment, and toxicity data. Responses from a follow-up survey were reviewed.RESULTS: The median age of diagnosis was 51 years, and 81% of survivors were Caucasian. The most commonly reported LLTEs for all survivors were neuropathy, fatigue, cognitive changes, changes in GI function, urogenital and sexual dysfunction, and dermatologic effects. The prevalence of these effects varied with time since diagnosis, treatment modality, and treatment center. Individuals who had survived anal cancer reported a high prevalence of sexual dysfunction and radiation-induced dermatologic effects. Over 87% of users reported satisfaction levels of good to excellent using the SCP tool, and 69% reported that they intend to share the SCP with their health care team.CONCLUSIONS: For lower GI cancer survivors, it is feasible to obtain PROs from an Internet-based survivorship tool. Survivors report a wide spectrum of LLTEs, and these can be used to inform counseling at the time of diagnosis and to help anticipate and respond to disease-related and treatment-related sequelae during follow-up. The authors are among the first to report on PROs in anal cancer survivors. Further investigation on the impact of SCPs on health care communication and use is needed.

28055109	Population-based screening program for reducing oral cancer mortality in 2,334,299 Taiwanese cigarette smokers and/or betel quid chewers.	BACKGROUND: To reduce oral cancer mortality, an organized, population-based screening program for the early detection of oral premalignancy and oral cancer was designed for high-risk individuals with habits of betel quid chewing, cigarette smoking, or both. The objective of this report was to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of this program in reducing the incidence of advanced disease and deaths from oral cancer.METHODS: A nationwide, population-based screening program for oral cancer has been conducted in Taiwan since 2004. Residents aged ≥ 18 years with oral habits of cigarette smoking and/or betel quid chewing were invited. The standardized mortality ratio method was used to compare the observed numbers of advanced oral cancers and deaths from oral cancer among screening attendees with the expected numbers derived from mortality among nonattendees. An intention-to-treat analysis of the relative rate of reductions in advanced-stage oral cancers and oral cancer mortality also was conducted.RESULTS: The overall screening rate was 55.1%. The relative risk of death from oral cancer was 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.56) as a result of screening compared with the expected risk of oral cancer deaths in the absence of screening. The corresponding relative risk was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.72-0.77) after adjusting for self-selection bias. The relative risk of advanced oral cancer for the screened group versus the nonscreened group was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.59-0.64), which increased to 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76-0.82) after adjustment for self-selection bias.CONCLUSIONS: An organized, population-based oral cancer screening program targeting more than 2 million Taiwanese cigarette smokers and/or betel quid chewers demonstrated the effectiveness of reducing stage III or IV oral cancers and oral cancer mortality. These evidence-based findings corroborate and support the screening strategy of oral visual inspection for the prevention of oral cancer among high-risk individuals in areas with a high incidence of oral cancer.

28055108	Impact of ethnicity on the outcome of men with metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.	BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) outcomes are impacted by socioeconomic and biologic factors. Ethnicity plays a role in the former, but little is known about the responsiveness of metastatic PCa to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) among races.METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry was used to identify men who were diagnosed with distant, de novo, metastatic PCa from 2004 to 2012. Patterns of presentation, overall survival (OS), and PCa-specific mortality (PCSM) were determined for each race. E3805 clinical trial data also were retrospectively reviewed to assess outcomes of ADT and ADT plus docetaxel by race.RESULTS: Of all PCa diagnoses in SEER, distant, de novo, metastatic disease was diagnosed in 4.2% of non-Hispanic whites, 5.8% of Hispanic whites, 5.7% of blacks, 5.5% of Asians/Pacific Islanders, and 8.8% of American Indians/Alaska Natives (P &lt; .001; chi-square test). The median OS differed by race, with superior OS observed among Asian men (30 months) than among men of other races (range, 24-25 months; P &lt; .001). Asians also had a superior median PCSM (54 months) compared with the other races (range, 35-40 months; P &lt; .001). In E3805, chemohormonal therapy was associated with a median OS of 58.1 months (95% confidence interval, 48.8-72.9 months) and 57.6 months (95% confidence interval, 27.7-57.6 months) in non-Hispanic whites and blacks, respectively. Few Asians participated in the E3805 trial.CONCLUSIONS: Asian men have superior median OS and PCSM for distant, de novo, metastatic PCa than men of other race. Non-Hispanic whites and blacks who receive treatment with ADT or chemohormonal therapy have comparable outcomes. Cancer 2017. © 2017 American Cancer Society.	NA	0
28055106	Imidazoquinoxaline derivative EAPB0503: A promising drug targeting mutant nucleophosmin 1 in acute myeloid leukemia.	BACKGROUND: Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein mainly localized in the nucleolus. NPM1 is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). NPM1c oligomerizes with wild-type nucleophosmin 1 (wt-NPM1), and this leads to its continuous cytoplasmic delocalization and contributes to leukemogenesis. Recent studies have shown that Cytoplasmic NPM1 (NPM1c) degradation leads to growth arrest and apoptosis of NPM1c AML cells and corrects wt-NPM1 normal nucleolar localization.METHODS: AML cells expressing wt-NPM1 or NPM1c or transfected with wt-NPM1 or NPM1c as well as wt-NPM1 and NPM1c AML xenograft mice were used. Cell growth was assessed with trypan blue or a CellTiter 96 proliferation kit. The cell cycle was studied with a propidium iodide (PI) assay. Caspase-mediated intrinsic apoptosis was assessed with annexin V/PI, the mitochondrial membrane potential, and poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase cleavage. The expression of NPM1, p53, phosphorylated p53, and p21 was analyzed via immunoblotting. Localization was performed with confocal microscopy. The leukemia burden was evaluated by flow cytometry with an anti-human CD45 antibody.RESULTS: The imidazoquinoxaline 1-(3-methoxyphenyl)-N-methylimidazo[1,2-a]quinoxalin-4-amine (EAPB0503) induced selective proteasome-mediated degradation of NPM1c, restored wt-NPM1 nucleolar localization in NPM1c AML cells, and thus yielded selective growth arrest and apoptosis. Introducing NPM1c to cells normally harboring wt-NPM1 sensitized them to EAPB0503 and led to their growth arrest. Moreover, EAPB0503 selectively reduced the leukemia burden in NPM1c AML xenograft mice.CONCLUSIONS: These findings further reinforce the idea of targeting the NPM1c oncoprotein to eradicate leukemic cells and warrant a broader preclinical evaluation and then a clinical evaluation of this promising drug.

28053548	Recombinant human endostatin in combination with CHOP regimen for peripheral T cell lymphoma.	Peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) has a poor prognosis. Overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) might contribute to the poor prognosis of PTCL and could be the target of novel therapy. The efficacy and safety of recombinant human endostatin (Endostar) in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (ECHOP) have been explored in 15 PTCL patients. The objective response rate was 80%, with 53.3% patients having achieved complete response (CR) rate. The CR rate was 100% (3/3) in angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) patients compared to only 36.4% (4/11) in PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) patients. With a median follow-up of 69 months, the 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) were 53% and 60%, respectively. The 5-year OS was 100% in AITL but was only 45% in PTCL-NOS. Seven out of 11 patients showed overexpression of VEGFR2 in their tumor vessels and had a better efficacy than those with low expression of VEGFR2. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia is the most common toxicity observed. ECHOP was safe and might display potential benefit in AITL patients.	NA	0
28053547	Anticancer activities of epigallocatechin-3-gallate against cholangiocarcinoma cells.	PURPOSE: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is an antioxidant agent derived from green tea. Because it has chemopreventive and anti-invasive effect against various cancer cells, EGCG can be used to inhibit proliferation and invasion of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells.METHODS: The anticancer effects of EGCG were studied using human CCA cells (HuCC-T1). Apoptosis was analyzed by Western blotting. Invasion and migration of cancer cells were assessed with Matrigel(®) and wound healing assays. An animal tumor xenograft model of HuCC-T1 was used to study the in vivo antitumor activities of EGCG.RESULTS: EGCG effectively inhibited the growth of HuCC-T1 cells with no adverse effects on the viability of 293T cells. EGCG induced apoptotic cell death at 5 µg/mL concentration. It inhibited the expression of mutant p53 and induced apoptotic molecular signals such as Bax/Bcl-2, Caspase, and cytochrome C. Furthermore, EGCG dose-dependently inhibited the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9, invasion, and migration. In the animal tumor xenograft model of HuCC-T1 cells, EGCG was subcutaneously administered beside the tumor for local treatment. EGCG efficiently inhibited growth of the tumor and suppressed carcinogenic molecular signals such as Notch1, MMP-2/9, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen.CONCLUSION: EGCG induced apoptosis of cancer cells without adverse effects on normal cells. EGCG inhibited growth, invasion, and migration of HuCC-T1 cells. We suggest EGCG as a promising candidate for local treatment of CCA.	NA	0
28053546	Comparing efficacy and survivals of initial treatments for elderly patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and clinical outcome of initial therapies for elderly patients with multiple myeloma (MM).METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were obtained through a comprehensive search. Response rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were the interested outcome measures. Network meta-analysis (NMA) using graph theory methodology to construct an NMA model, and sensitivity analysis were performed.RESULTS: Nineteen RCTs containing 7,235 participants and 17 treatments were included in the NMA. As compared to the classic melphalan plus prednisone (MP) regimen, the majority of other initial regimens showed higher rates of complete response/near complete response, overall response rate (ORR) and better PFS as well as OS. These four outcomes favored the two lenalidomide plus dexamethasone regimens (continuous lenalidomide and 18 cycles of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone), especially continuous lenalidomide plus dexamethasone regimen, over the majority of other regimens including the two established standard treatments (MP plus thalidomide or bortezomib) for elderly patients with newly diagnosed MM.CONCLUSION: Continuous lenalidomide plus dexamethasone ranked as the best regimen in terms of ORR and OS for the treatment of elderly patients with newly diagnosed MM.

28053545	High expression of long noncoding RNA HULC is a poor predictor of prognosis and regulates cell proliferation in glioma.	PURPOSE: Emerging studies show that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have important roles in carcinogenesis. This study investigated the role of lncRNA highly upregulated in liver cancer (HULC) expression in glioma and its clinical significance in glioma patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: HULC expression was detected in glioma tissues and cell lines by using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions. Association between HULC levels and clinicopathological factors and patients prognosis was also analyzed. Expression of HULC was restored and knocked down in glioma cell line U87 by using HULC cDNA and siRNA, respectively. CCK-8 and colony formation assays were used to investigate the role of HULC in the regulation of proliferation of glioma cells.RESULTS: HULC was highly expressed in glioma tissues, being closely related to age and grade of glioma. Univariate survival analysis demonstrated that high HULC levels were significantly associated with overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.422; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.220-0.806; P=0.009), and it remained an independent predictor for OS (HR, 0.340; 95% CI, 0.175-0.659; P=0.001) in multivariate Cox regression analysis. Functionally, forced expression of HULC results in increased cell proliferation and colony formation of U87 glioma cell line, whereas knockdown of HULC expression reduced these oncogenic properties of glioma cells.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that HULC may play an important role in glioma progression and will be further evaluated as a biomarker for predicting the survival of glioma patients.

28053544	nab-Paclitaxel as a potential partner with checkpoint inhibitors in solid tumors.	Tumors recognized by the host immune system are associated with better survival. However, the immune system is often suppressed in patients with established tumor burden. Stimulating the immune system to detect and kill tumor cells has been a challenge in cancer therapy for some time. Recently, novel cancer immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccine therapies, have emerged as promising therapeutic approaches for many solid tumors. However, for some tumors, immunotherapy alone has not provided significant benefits, and some may even be fully resistant to immunotherapy. It has been suggested that the immune system may require &quot;priming&quot; before an immunotherapy can elicit an immune response. Although chemotherapies are believed to be immunosuppressive, when given at the right dose and sequence these agents may provide this &quot;priming&quot; effect for the immune system. In addition to direct cytotoxic killing of tumor cells, standard chemotherapeutic agents can elicit immunogenicity through various mechanisms. This review highlights the general immunomodulatory properties of chemotherapy agents. It also provides a rationale for combined therapy with nab-paclitaxel and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Recent clinical trial data with these combination regimens in solid tumors are presented, along with a summary of ongoing trials.	NA	0
28053543	Expression of HPIP in epithelial ovarian carcinoma: a clinicopathological study.	OBJECTIVES: Hematopoietic pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor (PBX)-interacting protein (HPIP) plays an important role in cancer invasion and metastasis. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of HPIP in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical method was performed using 42 normal ovarian specimens and 145 specimens with EOC. The correlations of HPIP expression with the clinicopathological factors and prognosis of EOC patients were evaluated. Statistical analyses were performed using the chi-square test, multivariate Cox proportional hazard, and Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: HPIP expression in EOC was higher than that in normal tissues (P&lt;0.001). HPIP expression was significantly associated with histological grade, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, and lymphatic metastasis of EOC (P&lt;0.05). Patients with high HPIP expression had poorer overall survival and disease-free survival (P&lt;0.001) compared with patients with low HPIP expression. Multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that HPIP was an independent factor for overall survival and disease-free survival (P&lt;0.05).CONCLUSION: HPIP may be a valuable biomarker for predicting the prognosis of EOC patients and may serve as a potential target for cancer therapy.	prognostic	1
28053542	Reduction of AZGP1 predicts poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients in Northern China.	BACKGROUND: As a key regulator in lipid mobilization, AZGP1 has been reported to play a significant role in various cancers. This study was carried out to investigate the role of AZGP1 in the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients in Northern China.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through the application of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining, AZGP1 expression in ESCC tissues from Northern China was examined.RESULTS: Decreased expression of AZGP1 was observed in ~60% ESCC patients. AZGP1 downregulation was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.035), advanced clinical stage (P=0.018), poor prognosis for 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS; P&lt;0.001), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS; P=0.016), and metastasis-free survival (MeFS; P=0.014). In addition, Cox multivariate analysis revealed that AZGP1 downregulation remained to be an independent prognosticator for shorter DSS (P=0.001), LRFS (P=0.011), and MeFS (P=0.004).CONCLUSION: AZGP1 might be a candidate tumor suppressor and a potential novel prognostic biomarker for ESCC patients in Northern China.	prognostic	1
28053541	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with bevacizumab combined with paclitaxel liposome plus cisplatin: a case report and literature review.	Patients with stage IV nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) have a poor prognosis, even with effective chemotherapy. Target agents combined with chemotherapy may improve NPC patients' outcome. The case of a patient with NPC, who was treated by adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy after disease progression using first-line chemotherapy, is reported. Recently published literature about effects of combining bevacizumab with standard chemotherapy in NPC cell lines or patients are also reviewed and discussed. Consistent with a few preclinical trials and Phase II clinical trials, bevacizumab may reverse the drug resistance to chemotherapy, and its toxic side effects are well tolerated.	NA	0
28053540	A novel synthetic Asiatic acid derivative induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation and mobility of gastric cancer cells by suppressing STAT3 signaling pathway.	Activation of the transcription factor, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), has been linked to the proliferation and migration of a variety of human cancer cells. These actions occur via the upregulation or downregulation of cell survival and tumor suppressor genes, respectively. Importantly, agents that can suppress STAT3 activation have the potential for use in the prevention and treatment of various cancers. In this study, an Asiatic acid (AA) derivative, N-(2α,3β,23-acetoxyurs-12-en-28-oyl)-l-proline methyl ester (AA-PMe), is reported to dose dependently suppress constitutive STAT3 activation in gastric cancer cells. This inhibition was mediated by blockade of Janus-activated kinase 2. Additionally, AA-PMe regulated the expression of STAT3-modulated gene products, including cyclin D1, Bax, Bcl-2, c-Myc, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. Finally, transfection with both a STAT3 mimic and an inhibitor reversed the AA-PMe-driven modulation of STAT3 downstream gene products. Overall, these results suggest that AA-PMe is a novel blocker of STAT3 activation and has the potential for the prevention and treatment of gastric cancer.	NA	0
28054715	Tubal Origin of Ovarian Cancer - the Double-edged Sword of Haemoglobin.	Ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most malignant neoplasm of the gynaecologic tract. While the origins of many human malignant neoplasms are clear, the origin of HGSC remains poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits our understanding of its pathogenesis and compromises efforts devoted to develop better early detection tools and effective preventative intervention. The tubal origin of HGSC has been put forward since the initial report of dysplastic lesions (now known as serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas, or STICs) that morphologically resemble HGSC in the fallopian tube. These were observed in a group of patients with a genetic predisposition to ovarian cancer who were undergoing risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy. Since then, a series of clinico-pathological and molecular studies have characterized STICs and their concurrent HGSCs, and the results support the new paradigm of a tubal origin of many &quot;ovarian&quot; HGSCs. Reactive oxygen species-containing ovulatory follicular fluid has been thought to be the major culprit behind DNA damage in tubal epithelial cells, leading to either cell death or, if the cells survive, to mutagenesis. A recent report from this journal demonstrates that ferryl haemoglobin (Hb) in peritoneal fluid could prevent cell death from DNA-damaged fimbrial epithelial cells, facilitating ovulation-induced carcinogenesis of tubal epithelium. This timely study provides new insight into the tumour initiation event in HGSC development.	NA	0
28054337	Combined miRNA profiling and proteomics demonstrates that different miRNAs target a common set of proteins to promote colorectal cancer metastasis.	The process of liver colonisation in colorectal cancer remains poorly characterised. Here, we addressed the role of microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation in metastasis. We first compared miRNA expression profiles between colorectal cancer cell lines with different metastatic properties and then identified target proteins of the dysregulated miRNAs to establish their functions and prognostic value. We found that 38 miRNAs were differentially expressed between highly metastatic (KM12SM/SW620) and poorly metastatic (KM12C/SW480) cancer cell lines. After initial validation, we determined that three miRNAs (miR-424-3p, -503, and -1292) were overexpressed in metastatic colorectal cancer cell lines and human samples. Stable transduction of non-metastatic cells with each of the three miRNAs promoted metastatic properties in culture and increased liver colonisation in vivo. Moreover, miR-424-3p and miR-1292 were associated with poor prognosis in human patients. A quantitative proteomic analysis of colorectal cancer cells transfected with miR-424-3p, miR-503, or miR-1292 identified alterations in 149, 129, or 121 proteins, respectively, with an extensive overlap of the target proteins of the three miRNAs. Importantly, downregulation of two of these shared target proteins, CKB and UBA2, increased cell adhesion and proliferation in colorectal cancer cells. The capacity of distinct miRNAs to regulate the same mRNAs boosts the capacity of miRNAs to regulate cancer metastasis and underscores the necessity of targeting multiple miRNAs for effective cancer therapy.

28053137	Activation of CECR1 in M2-like TAMs promotes paracrine stimulation-mediated glial tumor progression.	BACKGROUND: The majority of glioma-associated microglia/macrophages have been identified as M2-type macrophages with immune suppressive and tumor supportive action. Recently, the extracellular adenosine deaminase protein Cat Eye Syndrome Critical Region Protein 1 (CECR1) was shown to regulate macrophage maturation. In this study, we investigate the role of CECR1 in the regulation of the glioma-associated macrophage response.METHODS: Expression of CECR1 was assessed in human glioma samples. CECR1-mediated macrophage response was studied in vitro, using donor derived CD14+ monocytes and the THP-1 monocytic cell line. The response of the human glioma cell line U87 to conditioned medium of macrophages preconditioned with recombinant human CECR1 or CECR1 silencing was also assessed.RESULTS: CECR1 was strongly expressed in high-grade gliomas (P &lt; .001) and correlated positively with the M2 phenotype markers in tumor-associated microglia/macrophages (TAMs) (overall, P &lt; .05). In vitro studies confirmed the presence of a significantly higher level of CECR1 expression in M2-like macrophages exposed to U87 conditioned medium (P &lt; .001). CECR1 knockdown or stimulation of macrophages affected differentiation toward the M2-like phenotype. Stimulation of U87 cells with conditioned medium of CECR1 knockdown or stimulated macrophages affected tumor cell proliferation and migration, coinciding with altered intracellular signaling of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). In glioma tissue samples, CECR1 expression correlated with Ki67 and MAPK signaling protein.CONCLUSIONS: CECR1 is a potent regulator of TAM polarization and is consistently highly expressed by M2-type TAMs, particularly in high-grade glioma. Paracrine effects induced by CECR1 in M2-like TAMs activate MAPK signaling and stimulate the proliferation and migration of glioma cells.	NA	0
28056459	Influence of Liver Inflammation on Liver Stiffness Measurement in Patients with Autoimmune Hepatitis Evaluation by Combinational Elastography.	OBJECTIVE: In order to evaluate the influence of liver inflammation on liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by the simultaneous use of shear wave and strain imaging (combinational elastography), shear wave and strain imaging were compared before and after initial therapy for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).METHODS: Nine AIH patients initially treated with steroid were enrolled. Transient elastography and real-time tissue elastography were performed just before and 1 month after the start of initial steroid treatment. Blood samples, LSM, and the liver fibrosis index (LFI) were compared.RESULTS: Aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.002) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.015) were significantly decreased after initial treatment. The LSM was 15.5 ± 9.6 kPa at baseline, decreasing to 7.2 ± 2.3 kPa after initial treatment p = 0.034). The LFI was 1.67 ± 0.67 at baseline and 1.61 ± 0.66 after initial treatment; no significant change in LFI was recognized (p = 0.842). Between ΔALT and ΔLSM, a significant regression equation could be calculated as follows: ΔALT = -0.55 + 0.654 × ΔLSM.CONCLUSIONS: Combinational elastography was useful in evaluating not only the degree of liver fibrosis, but also the degree of liver inflammation in AIH.

28056456	Bladder Metastases from Lung Cancer: Clinical and Pathological Implications: A Systematic Review.	Lung cancer is the tumor with the highest incidence in males worldwide and the most common cause of death from cancer overall; its high mortality is mostly due to its propensity to spread to other organs through lymphatic and blood vessels in spite of proper treatment. Bladder metastases from lung cancer are rare, with only 11 cases having been reported, all in recent years. This review aims to discuss some critical points regarding this uncommon condition, namely: (a) lung and bladder tumors share similar etiologic features; (b) almost all bladder metastases from lung cancer arise from lung adenocarcinomas; (c) cytology and superficial bladder biopsy may be falsely negative, since the neoplastic cells coming through the hematogenous route are typically located in the lamina propria and/or muscularis propria of the bladder wall; and (d) the differential diagnosis with primary bladder adenocarcinoma as well as primary and secondary small-cell carcinomas may be challenging. Though no definite conclusions can be drawn regarding treatment, we herein propose a practical algorithm to manage such patients based on available data.	NA	0
28056339	Asbestos-Induced Mesothelial to Fibroblastic Transition Is Modulated by the Inflammasome.	Despite the causal relationship established between malignant mesothelioma (MM) and asbestos exposure, the exact mechanism by which asbestos induces this neoplasm and other asbestos-related diseases is still not well understood. MM is characterized by chronic inflammation, which is believed to play an intrinsic role in the origin of this disease. We recently found that asbestos activates the nod-like receptor family member containing a pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in a protracted manner, leading to an up-regulation of IL-1β and IL-18 production in human mesothelial cells. Combined with biopersistence of asbestos fibers, we hypothesize that this creates an environment of chronic IL-1β signaling in human mesothelial cells, which may promote mesothelial to fibroblastic transition (MFT) in an NLRP3-dependent manner. Using a series of experiments, we found that asbestos induces a fibroblastic transition of mesothelial cells with a gain of mesenchymal markers (vimentin and N-cadherin), whereas epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin, are down-regulated. Use of siRNA against NLRP3, recombinant IL-1β, and IL-1 receptor antagonist confirmed the role of NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent IL-1β in the process. In vivo studies using wild-type and various inflammasome component knockout mice also revealed the process of asbestos-induced mesothelial to fibroblastic transition and its amelioration in caspase-1 knockout mice. Taken together, our data are the first to suggest that asbestos induces mesothelial to fibroblastic transition in an inflammasome-dependent manner.	NA	0
28054203	Molecular explorations of substituted 2-(4-phenylquinolin-2-yl) phenols as phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors and anticancer agents.	PURPOSE: Substituted 2-(4-phenylquinolin-2-yl) phenols (PQPDs) emerged as the inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and anticancer agents.METHOD: PI3K inhibition was assessed by competitive ELISA. Anticancer activity was evaluated against breast cancer (MCF-7), skin cancer (G-361), and colon cancer (HCT 116) cell lines.RESULTS: In PI3 Kinase assay, PQPDs 4c, 4d, and 4k were inactive with IC50 &gt;5 µM. IC50 for 4a, 4b, 4f-h, and 4j was ≥0.05 µM. Rest PQPDs IC50 was &lt;1.0 µM. Anticancer activity found selective toward breast cancer (MCF-7); 4a, 4b, and 4j were showed excellent inhibitory (73.95, 68.36, and 70.06%) and IC50 1.16 µM (4a), 2.07 µM (4b), 1.021 µM (4f) and 1.981 µM (4j) while the standard (Doxorubicin) found with IC50 1.812 µM (72% inhibition). PQPDs were docked into the active site of PI3 Kinase p110α (PDB ID: 2RD0). Docking results suggested the hydrophobic interactions in PI3K binding pocket conquered affinity of the most favorable binding ligands [4a, 4b: inhibitory constant (ki) = 53.33, 41.23 pM].CONCLUSION: PI3K assay and cancer cell line experimental results ensured that the inhibitory and anticancer activity potentials of PQPDs are more selective toward breast cancer treatments. PQPDs 4a, 4b, 4f, 4g, and 4j were displayed potent PI3 Kinase and anticancer activities. SAR studies demonstrated PQPDs as the PI3K precise inhibitors with the impending to treat various cancers.

However, the highest-quality evidence from rigorously conducted randomized clinical trials remains scant.Recognizing the paucity of data, we advocate participation in clinical trials, if available, at every stage of WM. Specific indications exist for initiation of therapy. Outside clinical trials, based on the synthesis of available evidence, we recommend bendamustine-rituximab as primary therapy for bulky disease, profound hematologic compromise, or constitutional symptoms attributable to WM. Dexamethasone-rituximab-cyclophosphamide is an alternative, particularly for nonbulky WM. Routine rituximab maintenance should be avoided. Plasma exchange should be promptly initiated before cytoreduction for hyperviscosity-related symptoms. Stem cell harvest for future use may be considered in first remission for patients 70 years or younger who are potential candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation. At relapse, retreatment with the original therapy is reasonable in patients with prior durable responses (time to next therapy ≥3 years) and good tolerability to previous regimen. Ibrutinib is efficacious in patients with relapsed or refractory disease harboring MYD88 L265P mutation. In the absence of neuropathy, a bortezomib-rituximab-based option is reasonable for relapsed or refractory disease. In select patients with chemosensitive disease, autologous stem cell transplantation should be considered at first or second relapse. Everolimus and purine analogs are suitable options for refractory or multiply relapsed WM. Our recommendations are periodically updated as new, clinically relevant information emerges.</AbstractText>: Recognizing the paucity of data, we advocate participation in clinical trials, if available, at every stage of WM.

In the absence of neuropathy, a bortezomib-rituximab-based option is reasonable for relapsed or refractory disease. In select patients with chemosensitive disease, autologous stem cell transplantation should be considered at first or second relapse. Everolimus and purine analogs are suitable options for refractory or multiply relapsed WM. Our recommendations are periodically updated as new, clinically relevant information emerges.	therapeutic	1

28056398	Clinical outcome of myeloid sarcoma in adult patients and effect of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Results from a multicenter survey.	INTRODUCTION: Myeloid Sarcoma (MS) is a rare hematologic myeloid neoplasm that can involve any site of the body. It can occur as an exclusively extramedullary form or it can be associated with an acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) or a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) at onset or at relapse. The rarity of MS does not enable prospective clinical trials and therefore a specific multicenter register can be useful for the clinical and biological studies of this rare disease.PATIENTS AND RESULTS: we report the clinical characteristics and outcome of 48 histologically confirmed MS, diagnosed and treated in 9 Italian Hematological Centers in the last 10 years. The patient's median age was 46 years. There were 9/48 de novo extramedullary MS, 24/48 de novo AML-related MS and 15/48 were secondary AML-related MS. The most common extramedullary anatomic sites of disease were: skin, lymph nodes and soft tissues. Forty-three patients (90%) underwent a program of intensive chemotherapy including FLAI, HDAC-IDA, HyperCVAD and MEC schemes, with a DDI of 5% and a CR Rate of 45%. Twenty-two (46%) patients underwent Allogeneic SCT, 13 from a MUD, 8 from an HLA-identical sibling donor and 1 from an haploidentical donor. The median OS of the whole population (48 pts) was 16.7 months. The OS probability at 1, 2 and 5 years was 64%, 39% and 33%, respectively. The OS was better in patients that underwent an intensive therapeutic program (median OS: 18 months vs 5 months). Among the intensively treated patients, in univariate analysis, the OS was better in young patients (P=0,008), in patients that underwent Allo-SCT (P=0,009) and in patients that achieved a CR during treatment (P=0,001), and was worse in pts with secondary AML-related MS (P=0,007). Age, response to intensive chemotherapy and Allo-SCT were the only three variables that significantly influenced DFS (P=0,02, P=0,01 and P=0,04, respectively). In multivariable analysis, Allo-SCT and response to intensive chemotherapy remained significant in predicting a better OS (P=0,04 and P=0,001, respectively), and response to intensive chemotherapy was the only significant variable in predicting DFS (P=0,01). After Allo-SCT we observe a survival advantage in patients who achieved a pre-transplant CR (P=0,008) and in those who developed a chronic GvHD (P=0,05).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS, both with de novo and secondary forms, still have a very unfavorable outcome and require an intensive therapeutic program, that includes Allo-SCT whenever possible. The outcome after Allo-SCT is positively influenced by the development of chronic GvHD suggesting a Graft versus MS effect.	NA	0
28053127	Potent EMT and CSC Phenotypes are Induced by Oncostatin-M in Pancreatic Cancer.	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is referred to as a silent killer due to the lack of clear symptoms, a lack of early detection methods, and a high frequency of metastasis at diagnosis. In addition, pancreatic cancer is remarkably resistant to chemotherapy, and clinical treatment options remain limited. The tumor microenvironment (TME) and associated factors are important determinants of metastatic capacity and drug resistance. Here, oncostatin M (OSM), an IL-6 cytokine family member, was identified as an important driver of mesenchymal and cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotypes. Furthermore, the generation of cells that harbor mesenchymal/CSC properties following OSM exposure resulted in enhanced tumorigenicity, increased metastasis, and resistance to gemcitabine. OSM induced the expression of ZEB1, Snail (SNAI1), and OSM receptor (OSMR), engaging a positive feedback loop to potentiate the mesenchymal/CSC program. Suppression of JAK1/2 by Ruxolitinib prevented STAT3-mediated transcription of ZEB1, SNAI1, and OSMR, as well as the emergence of a mesenchymal/CSC phenotype. Likewise, ZEB1 silencing, by shRNA-mediated knockdown, in OSM-driven mesenchymal/CSC reverted the phenotype back to an epithelial/non-CSC state. Importantly, the generation of cells with mesenchymal/CSC proprties was unique to OSM, and not observed following IL-6 exposure, implicating OSMR and downstream effector signaling as a distinct target in PDAC. Overall, these data demonstrate the capacity of OSM to regulate an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)/CSC plasticity program that promotes tumorigenic properties.IMPLICATIONS: Therapeutic targeting the OSM/OSMR axis within the TME may prevent or reverse the aggressive mesenchymal and CSC phenotypes associated with poor outcomes in patients with PDAC.

28054552	c-Src phosphorylation and activation of hexokinase promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis.	It is well known that c-Src has important roles in tumorigenesis. However, it remains unclear whether c-Src contributes to metabolic reprogramming. Here we find that c-Src can interact with and phosphorylate hexokinases HK1 and HK2, the rate-limiting enzymes in glycolysis. Tyrosine phosphorylation dramatically increases their catalytic activity and thus enhances glycolysis. Mechanistically, c-Src phosphorylation of HK1 at Tyr732 robustly decreases its Km and increases its Vmax by disrupting its dimer formation. Mutation in c-Src phosphorylation site of either HK1 or HK2 remarkably abrogates the stimulating effects of c-Src on glycolysis, cell proliferation, migration, invasion, tumorigenesis and metastasis. Due to its lower Km for glucose, HK1 rather than HK2 is required for tumour cell survival when glucose is scarce. Importantly, HK1-Y732 phosphorylation level remarkably correlates with the incidence and metastasis of various clinical cancers and may serve as a marker to predict metastasis risk of primary cancers.

28054140	Meis1 is critical to the maintenance of human acute myeloid leukemia cells independent of MLL rearrangements.	Although the outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has improved by optimized chemotherapy regimens and bone marrow transplantation, leukemia relapse remains one of the most challenging problems during therapy. Sustained existence of AML blasts is a fundamental determinant for the development of leukemia and resistance to therapy. Recent evidences suggest that Meis1 is tightly associated with the self-renewal capacity of normal hematopoietic stem cells. Meis1 was also found to be essential for the development of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemia. Whether Meis1 functions independently of MLL abnormality in the context of leukemia is unclear. Herein, we identified a distinct expression pattern of Meis1 in patients with newly diagnosed AML without MLL abnormality. High levels of Meis1 expression were found in 64 of 95 (67.4%) AML patients; whereas, 31 of 95 (32.6%) patients showed dramatically lower levels of Meis1, compared with the median level of Meis1 in healthy donors. The whole cohort and subgroup analyses further demonstrated that high Meis1 expression levels were associated with a resistance to conventional chemotherapy, compared with the group with low Meis1 levels (P = 0.014 and P = 0.029, respectively). In vitro knockdown experiments highlighted a role of Meis1 in regulating maintenance and survival of human AML cells. These results implicate that Meis1 functions as an important regulator during the progression of human AML and could be a prognostic factor independent of MLL abnormality.	NA	0
28054192	Five-Year Actual Overall Survival in Resected Pancreatic Cancer: A Contemporary Single-Institution Experience from a Multidisciplinary Perspective.	BACKGROUND: Successful surgical resection combined with effective perioperative therapy is essential for maximizing long-term survival for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent curative resection at our institution from January 2003 to May 2010 were reviewed. Demographic and clinical details were retrospectively collected from medical records and cancer registry data.RESULTS: Overall, 176 patients were included in the analysis (148 with de novo resectable disease and 28 with borderline resectable disease at presentation). Among 106 patients who received all perioperative therapy at our institution, 94% received neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant treatment in addition to resection. Actual all-cause 5-year overall survival (OS) for all 176 patients was 30.7%, with a median OS of 33.9 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 28.1-39.6 months]. For patients who received all perioperative therapy at our institution, actual all-cause 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 32.1%, with a median DFS of 28.8 months (95% CI 20.1-43.6 months). Of these patients, 67/106 (63%) recurred: 8 (8%) locoregional only; 52 (49%) systemic only; and 7 (7%) combined recurrence. No difference in survival rates or recurrence patterns was seen between resectable and borderline resectable patients. In multivariate analysis, tumor differentiation (poor vs. non-poor) and lymph node ratio &gt;20% produced a useful clinical model.CONCLUSION: The actual OS rates for resected pancreatic cancer shown in this study are reflective of those currently achievable at a tertiary medical center dedicated to this patient population. In considering these results, both frequency and type of adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy administered in the context of the clinical experience/management techniques of providers administering these treatments will be discussed.

28054191	Central Venous Pressure Drop After Hypovolemic Phlebotomy is a Strong Independent Predictor of Intraoperative Blood Loss During Liver Resection.	BACKGROUND: Intraoperative hypovolemic phlebotomy (HP) has been suggested to reduce central venous pressure (CVP) before hepatectomy. This study aimed to analyze the impact of CVP drop after HP on intraoperative blood loss and postoperative renal function.METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospective database including 100 consecutive patients (43 males and 57 females; mean age, 65 years; range 23-89 years) undergoing liver resection with HP was performed. The primary outcome variable was estimated blood loss (EBL), and the secondary outcome was postoperative serum creatinin (Scr). A multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of intraoperative blood loss.RESULTS: The median CVP before blood salvage was 8 mmHg (range 4-30 mmHg). The median volume of hypovolemic phlebotomy was 400 ml (range 200-1000 ml). After HP, CVP decreased to a median of 3 mmHg (range -2 to 16 mmHg), resulting in a median CVP drop of 5.5 mmHg (range 2-14 mmHg). The median EBL during liver resection was 165 ml (range 0-800 ml). The median preoperative serum creatinin (Scr) was 0.82 g/dl (range 0.5-1.74 g/dl), and the postoperative Scr on day 1 was 0.74 g/dl (range 0.44-1.68 g/dl). The CVP drop was associated with EBL (P &lt; 0.001). There was no significant impact of CVP drop on postoperative Scr.CONCLUSION: A CVP drop after HP is a strong independent predictor of EBL during liver resection. The authors advocate the routine use of HP to reduce perioperative blood loss and transfusion rates in liver surgery. As a predictive tool, CVP drop might help surgeons decide whether a laparoscopic approach is safe.	NA	0
28054189	Endoscopic Stenting Does Not Worsen Long Term Outcomes Amongst Patients Presenting with Obstruction from Colorectal Cancers.	BACKGROUND: Stenting has been increasingly adopted in colorectal cancer patients presenting with acute large bowel obstruction. However, long-term outcomes of stenting are lacking in the literature. Our study attempts to compare the long-term outcomes of colonic stenting and emergency surgery amongst left-sided colorectal cancer patients presenting with acute large bowel obstruction.METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients who presented with nonmetastatic colorectal cancer who underwent either endoscopic stenting or emergency surgery for acute large bowel obstruction was performed from January 2007 to April 2016. Patients were analysed in an intention-to-treat analysis.RESULTS: Forty-seven (46.1%) patients underwent emergency surgery, whereas 55 (53.9%) underwent colonic stenting with a technical success rate of 71.0%. Patients who underwent emergency surgery were more likely to develop severe complications compared with patients who underwent successful colonic stenting, but the difference was not statistically significant (odds ratio [OR] 2.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-11.3, p = 0.139). Patients were followed up for a median of 48.3 months (3.1-111) in the stenting group and 51.2 months (1.2-117.1) in the emergency surgery group. Recurrence rates between colonic stenting and emergency surgery were similar (25.6% vs. 21.3%, p = 0.500), with more anastomotic and peritoneal recurrences were noted in the emergency surgery group. 5 year disease free survival (77% vs. 73%, p = 0.708) and overall survival (86% vs. 62%, p = 0.064) also were similar.CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent endoscopic stenting for large bowel obstruction have comparable long-term outcomes as those who undergo emergency surgery. The role of endoscopic stenting in obstructed colorectal cancers merits further evaluation.	NA	0
28054188	Predictive Factors for Active Surveillance of Subcentimeter Thyroid Nodules with Highly Suspicious US Features.	PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess the outcomes of subcentimeter thyroid nodules with highly suspicious ultrasonography (US) features and to investigate the predictive factors associated with malignancy and aggressive biological behavior to determine appropriate candidate factors for active surveillance.METHODS: Between June 2011 and December 2013, 1866 subcentimeter thyroid nodules with highly suspicious US features that were subjected to US-guided fine needle aspiration and subsequent surgery or US follow-up of at least 2 years were evaluated. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent clinical characteristics and US features associated with the malignancy rate and aggressive biological behavior.RESULTS: Of the 1866 subcentimeter thyroid nodules, 821 (44.0%) were benign and 1045 (56.0%) were malignant. Age younger than 45 years, presence of microcalcification, and a taller than wide shape on US were associated independently with malignancy in the subcentimeter thyroid nodules (P &lt; 0.05). Of 1041 evaluated papillary microcarcinomas, a multivariate analysis revealed that male gender, presence of microcalcification, and a taller than wide on US were independently associated with lymph node metastasis and ATA intermediate risk (P &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Age younger than 45 years, male gender, and subcentimeter thyroid nodules exhibiting microcalcification, and a taller than wide shape on US might be not good candidate factors for active surveillance.

28055107	Results of a phase I-II study of fenretinide and rituximab for patients with indolent B-cell lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma.	Fenretinide, a synthetic retinoid, induces apoptotic cell death in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) and acts synergistically with rituximab in preclinical models. We report results from a phase I-II study of fenretinide with rituximab for B-NHLs. Eligible diagnoses included indolent B-NHL or mantle cell lymphoma. The phase I design de-escalated from fenretinide at 900 mg/m(2) PO BID for days 1-5 of a 7-day cycle. The phase II portion added 375 mg/m(2) IV rituximab weekly on weeks 5-9 then every 3 months. Fenretinide was continued until progression or intolerance. Thirty-two patients were treated: 7 in phase I, and 25 in phase II of the trial. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The phase II component utilized fenretinide 900 mg/m(2) twice daily with rituximab. The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were rash (n = 3) and neutropenia (n = 3). Responses were seen in 6 (24%) patients on the phase II study, with a median duration of response of 47 months (95% confidence interval, 2-56). The combination of fenretinide and rituximab was well tolerated, yielded a modest overall response rate, but with prolonged remission durations. Further study should focus on identifying the responsive subset of B-NHL.	NA	0
28055379	Relationship between RUNX1 and AXIN1 in ER-negative versus ER-positive Breast Cancer.	RUNX1 plays opposing roles in breast cancer: a tumor suppressor in estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)) disease and an oncogenic role in ER-negative (ER(-)) tumors. Potentially mediating the former, we have recently reported that RUNX1 prevents estrogen-driven suppression of the mRNA encoding the tumor suppressor AXIN1. Accordingly, AXIN1 protein expression was diminished upon RUNX1 silencing in ER(+) breast cancer cells and was positively correlated with AXIN1 protein expression across tumors with high levels of ER (1) . Here we report the surprising observation that RUNX1 and AXIN1 proteins are strongly correlated in ER(-) tumors as well. However, this correlation is not attributable to regulation of AXIN1 by RUNX1 or vice versa. The unexpected correlation between RUNX1, playing an oncogenic role in ER(-) breast cancer, and AXIN1, a well-established tumor suppressor hub, may be related to a high ratio between the expression of variant 2 and variant 1 (v2/v1) of AXIN1 in ER(-) compared to ER(+) breast cancer. Although both isoforms are similarly regulated by RUNX1 in estrogen-stimulated ER(+) breast cancer cells, the higher v2/v1 ratio in ER(-) disease is expected to weaken the tumor suppressor activity of AXIN1 in these tumors.

28055296	Eradication of melanoma in vitro and in vivo via targeting with a Killer-Red-containing telomerase-dependent adenovirus.	Melanoma is a highly recalcitrant cancer and transformative therapy is necessary for the cure of this disease. We recently developed a telomerase-dependent adenovirus containing the fluorescent protein Killer-Red. In the present report, we first determined the efficacy of Killer-Red adenovirus combined with laser irradiation on human melanoma cell lines in vitro. Cell viability of human melanoma cells was reduced in a dose-dependent and irradiation time-dependent manner. We used an intradermal xenografted melanoma model in nude mice to determine efficacy of the Killer-Red adenovirus. Intratumoral injection of Killer-Red adenovirus, combined with laser irradiation, eradicated the melanoma indicating the potential of a new paradigm of cancer therapy.	NA	0
28053093	Catalytic Determinants of Alkene Production by the Cytochrome P450 Peroxygenase OleTJE.	The Jeotgalicoccus sp. peroxygenase cytochrome P450 OleTJE (CYP152L1) is a hydrogen peroxide-driven oxidase that catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of fatty acids, producing terminal alkenes with applications as fine chemicals and biofuels. Understanding mechanisms that favor decarboxylation over fatty acid hydroxylation in OleTJE could enable protein engineering to improve catalysis or to introduce decarboxylation activity into P450s with different substrate preferences. In this manuscript, we have focused on OleTJE active site residues Phe79, His85 and Arg245 to interrogate their roles in substrate binding and catalytic activity. His85 is a potential proton donor to reactive iron-oxo species during substrate decarboxylation. The H85Q mutant substitutes a glutamine found in several peroxygenases that favor fatty acid hydroxylation. H85Q OleTJE still favors alkene production, suggesting alternative protonation mechanisms. However, the mutant undergoes only minor substrate binding-induced heme iron spin-state shift towards high-spin by comparison with WT OleTJE, indicating His85's key role in this process. Phe79 interacts with His85, and Phe79 mutants showed diminished affinity for shorter chain (C10-C16) fatty acids and weak substrate-induced high-spin conversion. F79A OleTJE is least affected in substrate oxidation, while the F79W/Y mutants exhibit lower stability and cysteine thiolate protonation on reduction. Finally, Arg245 is crucial for binding the substrate carboxylate, and R245E/L mutations severely compromise activity and heme content, although alkene products are formed from some substrates, including stearic acid (C18:0). The results identify crucial roles for the active site amino acid trio in determining OleTJE catalytic efficiency in alkene production, and in regulating protein stability, heme iron coordination and spin-state.

28053092	Histone Acetyltransferase PCAF is Required for All-trans Retinoic Acid-induced Granulocytic Differentiation in Leukemia Cells.	Differentiation therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) improves the treatment outcome of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL); however, the molecular mechanism by which ATRA induces granulocytic differentiation remains unclear. We previously reported that the inhibition of the NAD-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC) SIRT2 induces granulocytic differentiation in leukemia cells, suggesting the involvement of protein acetylation in ATRA-induced leukemia cell differentiation. Herein, we showed that p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor (PCAF), a histone acetyltransferase (HAT), is a prerequisite for ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation in leukemia cells. We found that PCAF expression was markedly increased in leukemia cell lines (NB4 and HL-60) and primary APL cells during ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation. Consistent with these results, the expression of PCAF was markedly upregulated in the bone marrow cells of APL patients who received ATRA-containing chemotherapy. The knockdown of PCAF inhibited ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation in leukemia cell lines and primary APL cells. Conversely, the overexpression of PCAF induced the expression of the granulocytic differentiation marker CD11b at the mRNA level. Acetylome analysis identified the acetylated proteins after ATRA treatment, and we found that histone H3, a known PCAF acetylation substrate, was preferentially acetylated by the ATRA treatment. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that PCAF is required for the acetylation of histone H3 on the promoter of ATRA target genes such as CCL2 and FGR, and for the expression of these genes in ATRA-treated leukemia cells. These results strongly support our hypothesis that PCAF is induced and activated by ATRA and the subsequent acetylation of PCAF substrates promotes granulocytic differentiation in leukemia cells. Targeting PCAF and its downstream acetylation targets could serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome all subtypes of AML.	NA	0
28053089	Individual Bromodomains of Polybromo-1 Contribute to Chromatin Association and Tumor Suppression in Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma.	The architecture of chromatin is governed, in part, by adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent chromatin remodelers. These multi-protein complexes contain targeting domains that recognize posttranslational marks on histones. One such targeting domain is the bromodomain (BD), which recognizes acetyl-lysines and recruits proteins to sites of acetylation across the genome. Polybromo1 (PBRM1), a subunit of the polybromo-associated BRG1- or hBRM-associated factors (P-BAF) chromatin remodeler, contains six tandem BDs and is frequently mutated in Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC). Mutations in the PBRM1 gene often lead to loss of protein expression; however, missense mutations in PBRM1 have been identified and tend to cluster in the BDs, particularly BD2 and BD4, suggesting that individual BDs are critical for PBRM1 function. To study the role of these six BDs, we inactivated each of the six BDs of PBRM1 and re-expressed these mutants in Caki2 cells (ccRCC cells with loss of function mutation of PBRM1). Four of the six BDs abrogated PBRM1 tumor suppressor, gene regulation, and chromatin affinity with degree of importance correlating strongly to rate of missense mutations in patients. Furthermore, we identified BD2 as the most critical for PBRM1 and confirmed BD2 mediated association to histone H3 peptides acetylated at lysine 14 (H3K14Ac), validating the importance of this specific acetylation mark for PBRM1 binding. From these data we conclude that four of the BDs act together to target PBRM1 to sites on chromatin; when a single BD is mutated, PBRM1 no longer controls gene expression properly, leading to increased cell proliferation.

28053088	Identification of the catalytic ubiquinone-binding site of Vibrio cholerae sodium-dependent NADH dehydrogenase: a novel ubiquinone-binding motif.	The sodium-dependent NADH dehydrogenase (Na+-NQR) is a key component of the respiratory chain of diverse prokaryotic species, including pathogenic bacteria. Na+-NQR uses the energy released by electron transfer between NADH and ubiquinone (UQ) to pump sodium, producing a gradient that sustains many essential homeostatic processes, as well as virulence factor secretion, and the elimination of drugs. The location of the UQ binding site has been controversial, with two main hypotheses that suggest that this site could be located in the cytosolic subunit A or in the membrane-bound subunit B. In this work, we performed Alanine scanning mutagenesis of aromatic residues located in transmembrane helices II, IV and V of subunit B, near glycine residues 140 and 141. These two critical glycine residues form part of the structures that regulate the site accessibility. Our results indicate that the elimination of phenylalanine residues 211 or 213 abolishes the UQ-dependent activity, produces a leak of electrons to oxygen, and completely blocks the binding of UQ and the inhibitor HQNO. Molecular docking calculations predict that UQ interacts with phenylalanine 211 and pinpoints the location of the binding site in the interface of subunits B and D. The mutagenesis and structural analysis allow us to propose a novel UQ-binding motif, which is completely different compared to the sites of other respiratory photosynthetic complexes. These results are essential to understanding the electron transfer pathways and mechanism of Na+-NQR catalysis.	NA	0
28054666	Cyclooxygenase-2 regulates TGFβ-induced cancer stemness in triple-negative breast cancer.	Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype of breast cancer, display poor prognosis and exhibit resistance to conventional therapies, partly due to an enrichment in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). Here, we investigated the role of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a downstream target of TGFβ, in regulating BCSCs in TNBC. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that COX-2 is highly expressed in TNBC and that its expression correlated with poor survival outcome in basal subtype of breast cancer. We also found TGFβ-mediated COX-2 expression to be Smad3-dependent and to be required for BCSC self-renewal and expansion in TNBCs. Knocking down COX-2 expression strikingly blocked TGFβ-induced tumorsphere formation and TGFβ-induced enrichment of the two stem-like cell populations, CD24(low)CD44(high) and ALDH+ BCSCs. Blocking COX-2 activity, using a pharmacological inhibitor also prevented TGFβ-induced BCSC self-renewal. Moreover, we found COX-2 to be required for TGFβ-induced expression of mesenchymal and basal breast cancer markers. In particular, we found that TGFβ-induced expression of fibronectin plays a central role in TGFβ-mediated breast cancer stemness. Together, our results describe a novel role for COX-2 in mediating the TGFβ effects on BCSC properties and imply that targeting the COX-2 pathway may prove useful for the treatment of TNBC by eliminating BCSCs.

28054649	Ameloblastin induces tumor suppressive phenotype and enhances chemosensitivity to doxorubicin via Src-Stat3 inactivation in osteosarcoma.	Ameloblastin (AMBN), the most abundant non-amelogenin enamel matrix protein, plays a role in ameloblast differentiation. Previously, we found that AMBN promoted osteogenic differentiation via the interaction between CD63 and integrin β1, leading to the inactivation of Src; however, how AMBN affects the malignant behavior of osteosarcoma is still unclear. Osteosarcoma affects the bone and is associated with poor prognosis because of the high rate of pulmonary metastases and drug resistance. Here we demonstrated that stable overexpression of AMBN induced apoptosis and suppressed colony formation and cell migration via the inactivation of Src-Stat3 pathway in human osteosarcoma cells. Moreover, AMBN induced chemosensitivity to doxorubicin. Thus, AMBN induced a tumor suppressive phenotype and chemosensitivity to doxorubicin via the AMBN-Src-Stat3 axis in osteosarcoma. Indeed, immunohistochemical expression of AMBN was significantly correlated with better outcome of osteosarcoma patients. Our findings suggest that AMBN can be a new prognostic marker and therapeutic target for osteosarcoma combined with conventional doxorubicin treatment.	NA	2
28054562	Identification of a Drug Targeting an Intrinsically Disordered Protein Involved in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.	Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are prevalent in eukaryotes, performing signaling and regulatory functions. Often associated with human diseases, they constitute drug-development targets. NUPR1 is a multifunctional IDP, over-expressed and involved in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development. By screening 1120 FDA-approved compounds, fifteen candidates were selected, and their interactions with NUPR1 were characterized by experimental and simulation techniques. The protein remained disordered upon binding to all fifteen candidates. These compounds were tested in PDAC-derived cell-based assays, and all induced cell-growth arrest and senescence, reduced cell migration, and decreased chemoresistance, mimicking NUPR1-deficiency. The most effective compound completely arrested tumor development in vivo on xenografted PDAC-derived cells in mice. Besides reporting the discovery of a compound targeting an intact IDP and specifically active against PDAC, our study proves the possibility to target the 'fuzzy' interface of a protein that remains disordered upon binding to its natural biological partners or to selected drugs.

28054548	Nanosecond Pulsed Electric Fields Enhance the Anti-tumour Effects of the mTOR Inhibitor Everolimus against Melanoma.	The PI3K/mTOR/AKT pathway is activated in most melanomas, but mTOR inhibitors used singly have limited activity against advanced melanomas. The application of nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) is a promising cancer therapy approach. In this study, we evaluated the synergistic anti-tumour efficacy of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in conjunction with nsPEFs against melanoma. The combined treatment of nsPEFs and everolimus gradually decreased cell growth concurrent with nsPEF intensity. nsPEFs alone or combined with everolimus could promote melanoma cell apoptosis, accompanied with a loss in cellular mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in Ca(2+) levels. In vivo experiments showed that a combination of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and nsPEFs improved the inhibitory effect, and all skin lesions caused by nsPEFs healed in 1 week without any observed adverse effect. Combination treatment induced caspase-dependent apoptosis through the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic factor Bax and downregulation of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2. Everolimus and nsPEFs synergistically inhibited angiogenesis by decreasing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor (VEGFR), and CD34. Our findings indicate that nsPEFs in combination with an mTOR inhibitor can be used as a potential treatment approach for advanced melanoma.	NA	0
28053323	HBx promotes cell proliferation by disturbing the cross-talk between miR-181a and PTEN.	Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is involved in the initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism is still needed to be elucidated. In this study, we explored the relationship between HBx and microRNA and their roles in hepato-carcinogenesis. Firstly, by global microarray-based microRNA profiling and qRT-PCR, we found miR-181a was strongly up-regulated in HepG2.2.15 cells (HBV positive) and pHBV1.3-expressing HepG2 cells, and HBx played a major role in it. Secondly, reduced PTEN protein expression in the presence of HBx was aslo mediated by miR-181a, and in the Luciferase reporter system, miR-181a inhibited the PTEN translation by binding the PTEN 3'-untranslated-region (UTR), and PTEN protein was decreased when epigenetic expression of miR-181a and rescued by knocking down miR-181a. Finally, HBx interrupted the balance between apoptosis and proliferation, which contributed to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, was also related to the interaction of miR-181a and PTEN. Taken together, we presented here a novel cross-talk between miR-181a and PTEN which was raised by HBx, and this shined a new line in HBV-related hepato-carcinogenesis.	NA	0
28054397	Conventional Cytogenetics for Myeloid Neoplasms in the Era of Next-Generation-Sequencing.	In this issue of the American Journal of Hematology, Weinberg et al.(1) discuss how multiple diagnostic techniques should be integrated in the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the risk stratification of patients.Ever since the discovery of Philadelphia chromosome more than 50 years ago(2) , conventional cytogenetic assays, including karyotype and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), have played a critical role in classification, diagnosis and management of AML and other myeloid neoplasms. Most, if not all, of the recurrent chromosomal rearrangements commonly seen in AML are now well-described and the genes involved in these rearrangements have been identified. In the 2016 revised World Health Organization (WHO) classification(3) , specific chromosomal rearrangements detectable by either karyotype or FISH are major determinants of the classification of AML and MDS, and the clinical cooperative groups and other organizations such as the European Leukemia Net (ELN) include karyotype as a fundamental component of prognostic assessment for AML, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).

28055304	Synergistic effect of cytokine-induced killer cell with valproate inhibits growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cell in a mouse model.	OBJECTIVE: Long-term prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor owing to the lack of treatment options for advanced HCC. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are ex vivo expanded T lymphocytes expressing both NK- and T-cell markers. CIK cell therapy alone is insufficient for treating advanced HCC. Thus, this study aimed to determine whether treatment with CIK cells combined with valproic acid (VPA) could provide a synergistic effect to inhibit tumor growth in a mouse model of HCC.METHODS: Upregulation of natural killer group 2 D (NKG2D) ligands (retinoic acid early inducible 1 [RAE-1], mouse; major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence A [MIC-A], human) were evaluated by FACS. VPA concentrations that did not reduce tumor volume were calculated to avoid VPA cytotoxicity in a C3H mouse model of HCC. CIK cells were generated from mouse splenocytes using interferon gamma, a CD3 monoclonal antibody, and interleukin 2. The potential synergistic effect of CIK cells combined with VPA was evaluated in the mouse model and tissue pathology was investigated.RESULTS: After 40 h of incubation with VPA, RAE-1 and MIC-A expression were increased in four HCC cell lines compared with that in control (2.3-fold in MH-134, 2.4-fold in Huh-7, 3.7-fold in SNU-761, and 6.5-fold in SNU-475). The maximal in vivo VPA dosage that showed no significant cytotoxicity compared with control was 10 mg/kg/day. CIK cells were well generated from C3H mouse splenocytes. After 7 days of treatment with CIK cells plus VPA, a synergistic effect was observed on relative tumor volume in the mouse model of HCC. While the relative tumor volume in untreated control mice increased to 11.25, that in the combination treatment group increased to only 5.20 (P = 0.047).CONCLUSIONS: The VPA-induced increase in NKG2D ligands expression significantly enhanced the effects of CIK cell therapy in a mouse model of HCC.

28055291	Metuzumab enhanced chemosensitivity and apoptosis in non-small cell lung carcinoma.	Targeted therapeutics is used as an alternative treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, treatment effect is far from being satisfactory, and therefore identification of new targets is needed. We have previously shown that metuzumab inhibit tumor growth in vivo. The present study was performed to investigate the anti-tumor efficacy of metuzumab combined with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GP), paclitaxel and cisplatin (TP) or navelbine and cisplatin (NP) regimens in multiple NSCLC cell lines. Our results demonstrate that, in comparison to single agent metuzumab or GP treated cells, metuzumab combined with GP display inhibitory effects on tumor growth. Furthermore, we found that metuzumab elevated the sensitivity of cell lines to gemcitabine, which was identified by MTT assay. Flow cytometric analysis showed that metuzumab combined with gemcitabine (GEM) treatment led to an obvious G1 arrest and an elevated apoptosis in A549, NCI-H460 and NCI-H520 cells. Western blot analysis also demonstrated a significantly reduced level of cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and an obviously increase level of Bax and full-length caspase-3 in A549, NCI-H460 and NCI-H520 cells treated with metuzumab/gemcitabine combination in comparison with single agent treated cells. In addition, metuzumab/gemcitabine treated A549, NCI-H460 and NCI-H520 cells also demonstrated a significantly increase in deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) protein level compared to single agent metuzumab or gemcitabine treated cells. Xenograft models also demonstrated that this metuzumab/gemcitabine combination led to up-regulation of dCK. Taken together, the mechanisms of metuzumab combined with GP repress tumor growth were that the combined treatment significantly inhibited the tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle in vitro and in vivo and at least partially by induction of dCK expression. Our results suggested that metuzumab could significantly enhance chemosensitivity of human NSCLC cells to gemcitabine. Metuzumab/gemcitabine combination treatment may be a potentially useful therapeutic regimen for NSCLC patients.	NA	0
28055019	REP1 inhibits FOXO3-mediated apoptosis to promote cancer cell survival.	Rab escort protein 1 (REP1) is a component of Rab geranyl-geranyl transferase 2 complex. Mutations in REP1 cause a disease called choroideremia (CHM), which is an X-linked eye disease. Although it is postulated that REP1 has functions in cell survival or death of various tissues in addition to the eye, how REP1 functions in normal and cancer cells remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that REP1 is required for the survival of intestinal cells in addition to eyes or a variety of cells in zebrafish, and also has important roles in tumorigenesis. Notably, REP1 is highly expressed in colon cancer tissues and cell lines, and silencing of REP1 sensitizes colon cancer cells to serum starvation- and 5-FU-induced apoptosis. In an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying REP1-mediated cell survival under those stress conditions, we identified FOXO3 as a binding partner of REP1 using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay system, and we demonstrated that REP1 blocked the nuclear trans-localization of FOXO3 through physically interacting with FOXO3, thereby suppressing FOXO3-mediated apoptosis. Importantly, the inhibition of REP1 combined with 5-FU treatment could lead to significant retarded tumor growth in a xenograft tumor model of human cancer cells. Thus, our results suggest that REP1 could be a new therapeutic target in combination treatment for colon cancer patients.	NA	2
28055018	Sumoylation-deficient Prdx6 gains protective function by amplifying enzymatic activity and stability and escapes oxidative stress-induced aberrant Sumoylation.	Aberrant Sumoylation of protein(s) in response to oxidative stress or during aging is known to be involved in etiopathogenesis of many diseases. Upon oxidative stress, Peroxiredoxin (Prdx) 6 is aberrantly Sumoylated by Sumo1, resulting in loss of functions and cell death. We identified lysines (K) 122 and 142 as the major Sumo1 conjugation sites in Prdx6. Intriguingly, the mutant Prdx6 K122/142 R (arginine) gained protective efficacy, increasing in abundance and promoting glutathione (GSH) peroxidase and acidic calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (aiPLA2) activities. Using lens epithelial cells derived from targeted inactivation of Prdx6(-/-) gene and relative enzymatic and stability assays, we discovered dramatic increases in GSH-peroxidase (30%) and aiPLA2 (37%) activities and stability in the K122/142 R mutant, suggesting Sumo1 destabilized Prdx6 integrity. Prdx6(-/-)LECs with EGFP-Sumo1 transduced or co-expressed with mutant TAT-HA-Prdx6K122/142 R or pGFP-Prdx6K122/142 R were highly resistant to oxidative stress, demonstrating mutant protein escaped and interrupted the Prdx6 aberrant Sumoylation-mediated cell death pathway. Mutational analysis of functional sites showed that both peroxidase and PLA2 active sites were necessary for mutant Prdx6 function, and that Prdx6 phosphorylation (at T177 residue) was essential for optimum PLA2 activity. Our work reveals the involvement of oxidative stress-induced aberrant Sumoylation in dysregulation of Prdx6 function. Mutant Prdx6 at its Sumo1 sites escapes and abates this adverse process by maintaining its integrity and gaining function. We propose that the K122/142R mutant of Prdx6 in the form of a TAT-fusion protein may be an easily applicable intervention for pathobiology of cells related to aberrant Sumoylation signaling in aging or oxidative stress.

28055016	Inhibition of Stat3 signaling pathway by nifuroxazide improves antitumor immunity and impairs colorectal carcinoma metastasis.	Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the one of the most common cancers with considerable metastatic potential, explaining the need for new drug candidates that inhibit tumor metastasis. The signal transducers and activators of the transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling pathway has an important role in CRC and has been validated as a promising anticancer target for CRC therapy. In the present study, we report our findings on nifuroxazide, an antidiarrheal agent identified as an inhibitor of Stat3. Our studies showed that nifuroxazide decreased the viability of three CRC cell lines and induced apoptosis of cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, western blot analysis demonstrated that the occurrence of its apoptosis was correlated with the activation of Bax and cleaved caspase-3, and decreased the expression of Bcl-2. In addition, nifuroxazide markedly impaired CRC cell migration and invasion by downregulating phosphorylated-Stat3(Tyr705), and also impaired the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9). Furthermore, our studies showed that nifuroxazide also significantly inhibited the tumor metastasis in lung and abdomen metastasis models of colon cancer. Meanwhile, nifuroxazide functionally reduced the proliferation index, induced tumor apoptosis and impaired metastasis. Notably, nifuroxazide reduced the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the blood, spleens and tumors, accompanied by the increased infiltration of CD8(+) T cells in the tumors. Importantly, a marked decrease in the number of M2-type macrophages in tumor in the abdomen metastasis model was also observed. Taken together, our results indicated that nifuroxazide could effectively inhibit tumor metastasis by mediating Stat3 pathway and it might have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of CRC.	NA	0
28055015	The TAZ-miR-224-SMAD4 axis promotes tumorigenesis in osteosarcoma.	Transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) is a downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway that participates in tumorigenesis. The aim of this study was to identify the miRNA counterpart for TAZ and elucidate the mechanism underlying the tumorigenic effect of TAZ. We demonstrated that TAZ is upregulated in osteosarcoma (OS) tissues and cell lines, and that TAZ overexpression can induce cell migration, invasion and proliferation. Moreover, miRNA-224 (miR-224), a TAZ phenocopy that functions downstream of TAZ, was found to be upregulated with TAZ overexpression. Further, a mechanistic study revealed that miR-224 functions by inhibiting the tumor suppressor, SMAD4, to support the proliferation and migration of OS cells. Our findings indicate that targeting TAZ and miR-224 could be a promising approach for the treatment of OS.	NA	2
28055013	MicroRNA-494 inhibits breast cancer progression by directly targeting PAK1.	MicroRNA (miRNA) is involved in the progression and metastasis of diverse human cancers, including breast cancer, as strong evidence has been found that miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Here, we show that miR-494 is decreased in human breast cancer specimens and breast cancer cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR-494 in basal-like breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231-LUC-D2H3LN and BT-549 inhibits clonogenic ability and metastasis-relevant traits in vitro. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-494 suppresses neoplasm initiation as well as pulmonary metastasis in vivo. Further studies have identified PAK1, as a direct target gene of miR-494, contributes to the functions of miR-494. Remarkably, the expression of PAK1 is inversely correlated with the level of miR-494 in human breast cancer samples. Furthermore, re-expression of PAK1 partially reverses miR-494-mediated proliferative and clonogenic inhibition as well as migration and invasion suppression in breast cancer cells. Taken together, these findings highlight an important role for miR-494 in the regulation of progression and metastatic potential of breast cancer and suggest a potential application of miR-494 in breast cancer treatment.

28054150	Ki-67 labeling index of neuroendocrine tumors of the lung has a high level of correspondence between biopsy samples and surgical specimens when strict counting guidelines are applied.	Optimal histopathological analysis of biopsies from metastases of neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of the lung requires more than morphology only. Additional parameters such as Ki-67 labeling index are required for adequate diagnosis, but few studies have compared reproducibility of different counting protocols and modalities of reporting on biopsies of lung NET. We compared the results of four different manual counting techniques to establish Ki-67 LI. On 47 paired biopsies and surgical specimens from 22 typical carcinoids (TCs), 14 atypical carcinoids (ACs), six large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNECs), and five small cell carcinomas (SCCs) immunohistochemical staining of Ki-67 antigen was performed. We counted, in regions of highest nuclear staining (HSR), a full ×40-high-power field (diameter = 0.55 mm), 500 or 2000 cells, or 2 mm(2) surface area, including the HSR or the entire biopsy fragment(s). Mitoses and necrosis were evaluated in an area of 2 mm(2) or the entire biopsy fragment(s). Between the four counting methods, no differences in Ki-67 LI were observed. However, a Ki-67 LI higher than 5% was found in only four cases when in an HSR, 500 cells were counted (18%), five (23%) when in an HSR 2000 cells were counted, four (18%) when 2 mm(2) were counted, and one (5%) TC case when the entire biopsy was counted. A 20% cutoff distinguished TC and AC from LCNEC and SCC with 100% specificity and sensitivity, while mitoses and necrosis failed to a large extent. Ki-67 LI in biopsy samples was concordant with that in resection specimens when 2000 cells, 2 mm(2), or the entire biopsy fragment(s) were counted. Our results are important for clinical management of patients with metastases of a lung NET.	NA	0
28056392	Trends of classification, incidence, mortality, and survival of MDS patients in Switzerland between 2001 and 2012.	Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are emerging disorders of the elderly with an increasing burden on healthcare systems. He we report on the first population-based, epidemiological analysis of patients diagnosed with MDS in Switzerland between 2001 and 2012. The aim of this study was to characterize the extent and limitations of currently available population-based, epidemiological data and formulate recommendations for future health services research. The investigated outcomes comprised trends of annual case frequency, classification of morphological subtypes, incidence, mortality and survival. Annual case frequency increased by 20% (from 263 to 315 cases per year), whereas age-standardized incidence-/mortality-rates remained stable (2.5/1.1 per 100'000 person-years). This observation reflects population growth as well as higher diagnostic awareness and not an increase of age-specific risk. However, it will inevitably influence the future prevalence of MDS and the impact on healthcare systems. Reporting of classification in MDS subtypes was poor with modest improvement from 20% to 39% and increased awareness for mainly higher-risk diseases. Relative survival for all patients at 5-years (RS) ranged between 37 and 40%. Significant better RS was found for younger compared to older higher-risk MDS patients (48% vs. 17%), reflecting the effect of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. However, no survival advantage was found in elderly patients after introduction of hypomethylating agents as standard for care in this patient group. Our data is in line with results from other MDS and cancer registries. It allows formulating recommendations for future collaborative health services research on MDS patients with national and international partners.	NA	0
28056391	Proton pump inhibitors on pancreatic cancer risk and survival.	BACKGROUND: Hypergastrinemia may promote the development and progression of pancreatic cancer. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is known to cause hypergastrinemia. We sought to determine the association between PPI therapy and the risk of developing pancreatic cancer as well as survival following pancreatic cancer diagnosis.METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study and a retrospective cohort study in The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a medical records database representative of the UK population. In the case-control study, each patient with incident pancreatic cancer was matched with up to four controls based on age, sex, practice site and both duration and calendar time of follow-up using incidence density sampling. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for pancreatic cancer risk associated with PPI use were estimated using multivariable conditional logistic regression. The retrospective cohort study compared the survival of pancreatic cancer patients according to their PPI exposure at the time of diagnosis. The effect of PPI use on pancreatic cancer survival was assessed using a multivariable Cox regression analysis.RESULTS: The case-control study included 4113 cases and 16,072 matched controls. PPI use was more prevalent in cases than controls (53% vs. 26% active users). Adjusting for diabetes, smoking, alcohol use and BMI, PPI users including both former users and active users with longer cumulative PPI use had a higher risk of pancreatic cancer compared to non-users. When assessing survival following pancreatic cancer diagnosis, only short-term, active users had a modest decrease in survival.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term PPI therapy may be associated with pancreatic cancer risk. While PPI users recently started on treatment had a slightly worse survival, this result likely is from reverse causation.	NA	0

OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to determine whether racial disparities exist in hospitalization outcomes among African-American and White hospitalized prostate cancer patients in the United States. We evaluated racial differences among matched groups of patients in post-operative complications, hospital length of stay and in-hospital mortality.METHODS: We identified a total of 183,856 men aged 40 years and older with a primary diagnosis of prostate cancer, of which 58,701 underwent prostatectomy, through the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, and matched all African-American patients with White patients on: 1) Demographics, 2) Demographics+Clinical presentation and 3) Demographics+Clinical presentation+Treatment. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted in SAS and estimates were reported with 95% confidence intervals.RESULTS: African-American patients were more likely to be admitted with metastatic disease (24.8%) compared with White patients matched on demographics (17.9%), and demographics+presentation (23.6%). However, 23.9% of African-American patients received surgery compared with 38.2% and 34.2% of Whites matched on demographics and demographics+presentation, respectively. White patients had lower in-hospital mortality compared with African-American patients matched on demographics (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.66-0.79), demographics+presentation (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.96), but was no longer significantly lower when matched on demographics, presentation and treatment (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.85-1.00).CONCLUSION: There were significant racial differences in outcomes among prostate cancer patients within the inpatient setting, even after accounting for demographic and presentation differences.

The effects of laminin on the response to tamoxifen were determined and the involvement of alpha-6 integrin was investigated.We found that pre-treatment with laminin leads to a decrease in cells with the ability to form mammospheres that was accompanied by a decrease in ALDH activity. Moreover, exposure of mammospheres to laminin reduced the capacity to form secondary mammospheres and decreased the expression of Sox-2, Nanog and Oct-4. We previously reported that 4-OH-tamoxifen leads to an increase in the expression of these genes in LM05-E cells. Treatment with signaling pathway inhibitors revealed that the MAPK/ERK pathway mediates the effects of laminin. Finally, laminin induced tamoxifen resistance in LM05-E cells through alpha 6 integrin.</AbstractText>: We found that pre-treatment with laminin leads to a decrease in cells with the ability to form mammospheres that was accompanied by a decrease in ALDH activity.

28052653	How Can We Treat Cancer Disease Not Cancer Cells?	Since molecular biology studies began, researches in biological science have centered on proteins and genes at molecular level of a single cell. Cancer research has also focused on various functions of proteins and genes that distinguish cancer cells from normal cells. Accordingly, most contemporary anticancer drugs have been developed to target abnormal characteristics of cancer cells. Despite the great advances in the development of anticancer drugs, vast majority of patients with advanced cancer have shown grim prognosis and high rate of relapse. To resolve this problem, we must reevaluate our focuses in current cancer research. Cancer should be considered as a systemic disease because cancer cells undergo a complex interaction with various surrounding cells in cancer tissue and spread to whole body through metastasis under the control of the systemic modulation. Human body relies on the cooperative interaction between various tissues and organs, and each organ performs its specialized function through tissue-specific cell networks. Therefore, investigation of the tumor-specific cell networks can provide novel strategy to overcome the limitation of current cancer research. This review presents the limitations of the current cancer research, emphasizing the necessity of studying tissue-specific cell network which could be a new perspective on treating cancer disease, not cancer cells.

28052652	Anti-angiogenic Therapy in Patients with Advanced Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer: A Systematic Review.	Despite advancements in therapy for advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers, their prognosis remains dismal. Tumor angiogenesis plays a key role in cancer growth and metastasis, and recent studies indicate that pharmacologic blockade of angiogenesis is a promising approach to therapy. In this systematic review, we summarize current literature on the clinical benefit of anti-angiogenic agents in advanced gastric cancer. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and conference proceedings including the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the European Society for Medical Oncology, and the European Cancer Congress. Included studies aimed to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-angiogenic agents in advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer. Each trial investigated at least one of the following endpoints: overall survival, progression-free survival/time to progression, and/or objective response rate. Our search yielded 139 publications. Forty-two met the predefined inclusion criteria. Included studies reported outcomes with apatinib, axitinib, bevacizumab, orantinib, pazopanib, ramucirumab, regorafenib, sorafenib, sunitinib, telatinib, and vandetanib. Second-line therapy with ramucirumab and third-line therapy with apatinib are the only anti-angiogenic agents so far shown to significantly improve survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer. Overall, agents that specifically target the vascular endothelial growth factor ligand or receptor have better safety profile compared to multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitors.	NA	0

Real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to confirm the expression of differentially expressed miRNAs. The cellular effects of miR-1246 were further examined by MTT assay, immunoblotting analysis, cell cycle analysis, flow cytometric assay of apoptosis, and autophagy assay.The miRNA microarray analysis and qRT-PCR identified five miRNAs (miR-3617, miR-92a-1, miR-1246, miR-193b-3p, and miR-17-3p) with expression that was consistently altered in two BRAF inhibitor-resistant cell lines. Among the five miRNAs, a miR-1246 mimic significantly reduced the antiproliferative effects of the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 in BRAF inhibitor-resistant A375P (A375P/Mdr) cells, suggesting that miR-1246 upregulation confers acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition. In particular, apoptosis was identified as a major type of cell death in miR-1246-transfected cells; however, necrosis predominated in mimic-control-transfected cells, indicating that the resistance to PLX4720 in miR-1246 mimic-transfected cells is predominantly due to a reduction in necrosis. Furthermore, we found that miR-1246 promoted G2/M arrest through autophagy as a way to escape cell death by necrosis and apoptosis in response to PLX4720. The promotion of BRAF inhibitor resistance by miR-1246 was associated with lowered levels of p-ERK.</AbstractText>: The miRNA microarray analysis and qRT-PCR identified five miRNAs (miR-3617, miR-92a-1, miR-1246, miR-193b-3p, and miR-17-3p) with expression that was consistently altered in two BRAF inhibitor-resistant cell lines.

28054320	Pembrolizumab for advanced melanoma: experience from the Spanish Expanded Access Program.	BACKGROUND: The programmed death (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab has been recently approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma. We evaluated the clinical activity of pembrolizumab in melanoma patients treated under the Spanish Expanded Access Program.METHODS: Advanced melanoma patients who failed to previous treatment lines were treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Patients with brain metastases were not excluded if they were asymptomatic. Data were retrospectively collected from 21 centers in the Spanish Melanoma Group.RESULTS: Sixty-seven advanced melanoma patients were analyzed. Most patients were stage M1c (73.1%), had high LDH levels (55.2%) and had ECOG PS 1 or higher (59.7%). For cutaneous melanoma patients, median overall survival was 14.0 months; the 18-month overall survival rate was 47.1%. Overall response rate was 27%, including three patients with complete responses (6.5%). Median response duration was not reached, with 83.3% of responses ongoing (3.5 m+ to 20.4 m+). From ten patients included with brain metastases, four (40%) had an objective response, two (20%) of them achieved a complete response. Significant prognostic factors for overall survival were LDH level, ECOG PS and objective response. There were no serious adverse events.CONCLUSION: Although this was a heavily pretreated cohort, pembrolizumab activity at the approved dose and schedule was confirmed in the clinical setting with long-term responders, also including patients with brain metastases.

28054319	Exosomal microRNAs in liquid biopsies: future biomarkers for prostate cancer.	Prostate cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer in males in the world. Plasma quantification of prostate-specific antigen substantially improved the early detection of prostate cancer, but still lacks the required specificity. Clinical management of prostate cancer needs advances in the development of new non-invasive biomarkers, ameliorating current diagnosis and prognosis and guiding therapeutic decisions. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. These miRNAs are expressed in the cells and are also present in cell-derived extracellular vesicles such as exosomes. Exosomes have been shown to act as mediators for cell to cell communication because of the regulatory functions of their content. High levels of exosomes are found in several body fluids from cancer patients and could be a potential source of non-invasive biomarkers. In this review, we summarize the diagnostic and prognostic utility of exosomal miRNAs in prostate cancer.	NA	0
28054318	Treating patients with ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer: mechanisms of resistance and strategies to overcome it.	Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement is detected in 3-7% of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Crizotinib is an ALK inhibitor, which was approved in 2011 for the treatment of ALK-positive lung cancer. Despite the initial enthusiasm, most of the patients develop resistance within the first year of treatment. The main mechanisms are secondary mutations and bypass track activation. Moreover, crizotinib has low penetration into the central nervous system. The need to overcome these limitations has led to the development of second-generation inhibitors that have better effectiveness against crizotinib-resistant mutations and brain metastases. Ceritinib and alectinib are the only approved drugs of this group. Many ongoing trials try to define the most appropriate agent for the treatment of ALK-positive lung cancer depending on the responsible mechanism. This review focuses on the current data regarding the potential mechanisms of resistance to ALK inhibitors and the strategies to overcome it.	NA	2
28052934	Fixed-dose combinations of pioglitazone and metformin for lung cancer prevention.	Combination treatment with pioglitazone and metformin are utilized clinically in the treatment of type II diabetes. Treatment with this drug combination reduced the development of aerodigestive cancers in this patient population. Our goal is to expand this treatment into clinical lung cancer chemoprevention. We hypothesized that dietary delivery of metformin/pioglitazone would prevent lung adenoma formation in A/J mice in a B[a]P-induced carcinogenesis model while modulating chemoprevention and anti-inflammatory biomarkers in residual adenomas. We found metformin (500 &amp; 850 mg/kg/day) and pioglitazone (15 mg/kg/day) produced statistically significant decreases in lung adenoma formation both as single agent treatments and in combination, compared to untreated controls, after 15 weeks. Treatment with metformin alone and in combination with pioglitazone resulted in statistically significant decreases in lung adenoma formation at both early and late stage interventions. Pioglitazone alone resulted in significant decreases in adenoma formation only at early treatment intervention. We conclude oral metformin is a viable chemopreventive treatment at doses ranging from 500 to 1000 mg/kg/day. Pioglitazone at 15 mg/kg/day is a viable chemopreventive agent at early stage interventions. Combination metformin and pioglitazone performed equal to metformin alone and better than pioglitazone at 15 mg/kg/day. Since the drugs are already FDA approved, rapid movement to human clinical studies is possible.	NA	0
28052691	Strategies to prevent peritoneal carcinomatosis arising from colorectal cancer.	In the last decades, cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy became a curative option for peritoneal metastases in selected patients, otherwise considered for palliative therapy alone. Better knowledge of physiopathology of peritoneal spread and identification of predictive factors for peritoneal relapse prompted specialized centers to investigate the role of a 'proactive approach' in order to early detect peritoneal metastasis. These encouraging data could justify an active attitude in selected patients at high risk of peritoneal recurrence after curative resection of primary tumor. Selection criteria and the timing of complementary hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy remain important points of discussion. In this article, we will discuss treatment principles and future perspectives to early treat and, if possible, to prevent peritoneal dissemination after curative treatment of colorectal cancer.	NA	0
28052688	TERT promoter mutation status in sarcomatoid urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract.	AIM: To determine TERT promoter mutation status as well as the expression of PAX8, GATA3, p63, p40, p53 and uroplakin III in 17 patients with the upper urinary tract sarcomatoid urothelial carcinoma.METHODS &amp; RESULTS:  TERT C228T mutations were found in six of 17 cases (35%). p53 was expressed in 77% of these tumors. PAX8, GATA3, p40 and uroplakin III are less frequently expressed. Lymph node metastases were present in ten cases (59%). Eight patients (47%), including all three patients with TERT mutation, died of cancer within 2 years after surgery.CONCLUSION: Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the upper urinary tract is an aggressive tumor and the presence of TERT mutation may portend poor prognosis.	prognostic	1

28055020	Participant-perceived understanding and perspectives on pharmacogenomics: the Mayo Clinic RIGHT protocol (Right Drug, Right Dose, Right Time).	PURPOSE: To examine predictors of understanding preemptive CYP2D6 pharmacogenomics test results and to identify key features required to improve future educational efforts of preemptive pharmacogenomics testing.METHODS: One thousand ten participants were surveyed after receiving preemptive CYP2D6 pharmacogenomics test results.RESULTS: Eighty-six percent (n = 869) of patients responded. Of the responders, 98% were white and 55% were female; 57% had 4 years or more of post-secondary education and an average age of 58.9 ± 5.5 years. Twenty-six percent said that they only somewhat understood their results and 7% reported they did not understand them at all. Only education predicted understanding. The most common suggestion for improvement was the use of layperson's terms when reporting results. In addition, responders suggested that results should be personalized by referring to medications that they were currently using. Of those reporting imperfect drug adherence, most (91%) reported they would be more likely to use medication as prescribed if pharmacogenomic information was used to help select the drug or dose.CONCLUSION: Despite great efforts to simplify pharmacogenomic results (or because of them), approximately one-third of responders did not understand their results. Future efforts need to provide more examples and tailor results to the individual. Incorporation of pharmacogenomics is likely to improve medication adherence.Genet Med advance online publication 05 January 2017Genetics in Medicine (2017); doi:10.1038/gim.2016.192.	NA	0

28061482	Genomic mutation-driven metastatic breast cancer therapy: a single center experience.	BACKGROUND: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has made genomic mutation-driven therapy feasible for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. We frequently submit tumor tissue from MBC patients for targeted NGS of tumor using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (FoundationOne®, Foundation Medicine, MA). Herein, we report the results and clinical impact of this test in MBC patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified patients with MBC treated at City of Hope from January 2014 to May 2016 who underwent NGS. Patients' clinical characteristics, response to treatment (clinical assessment of tumor regression), and genomic mutation profiles were reviewed.RESULTS: Forty-four patients with MBC underwent NGS: 24 triple negative breast cancer, 16 estrogen receptor positive, and 4 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive patients. Twenty-three patients received more than three lines of chemotherapy prior to NGS. Actionable mutations (potentially responsive to targeted therapies that are on the market or in registered clinical trials) were identified in almost all patients (42/44; 95%) and over half of these 42 patients with actionable mutations (23/42; 55%) initiated mutation-driven targeted therapies. Of these 23 patients, 16/23 (70%) had assessable responses, and 7/23 (30%) were not assessable for response due to short exposure (&lt;2 weeks) or hospice transition. The remaining 19/42 (45%) patients did not initiate targeted therapy.CONCLUSION: NGS can identify effective targeted therapy options for MBC patients based on actionable mutations that were not previously offered based on pathology type. NGS should be performed early in patients with good performance status and preferably in clinical settings where genomic mutation-driven therapeutic trials are available.	NA	2
28061481	B7-H4 promotes tumor growth and metastatic progression in lung cancer by impacting cell proliferation and survival.	Aberrant expression of B7-H4 occurs across a broad spectrum of human cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the key role of B7-H4 during tumorigenesis and metastasis of human lung cancer. Our data showed that the shRNA-mediated disruption of B7-H4 markedly inhibited tumor cell proliferation, invasion and migration, increased cell apoptosis and arrested cell cycle at G0/G1. These changes were accompanied by a marked increase in Bax and caspase-3/caspase-8, but a decrease in Bcl-2, cyclinD1 and activation of AKT. In addition, our shRNA-mediated disruption of B7-H4 led to a marked decrease in tumor growth in the immune-compromised mice. Importantly, B7-H4 was expressed in 53.33% of lung carcinomas from our patient cohort (n = 90), but not in any of adjacent non-cancerous tissues, according to our IHC analyses. In particular, B7-H4 expression appeared to be associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.008) and TNM stage (P = 0.012). Taken together, our study demonstrates a strong promoting role of B7-H4 in lung tumor growth, progression and metastasis, and supports its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of the disease.	association	1
28061480	Co-ordinated overexpression of SIRT1 and STAT3 is associated with poor survival outcome in gastric cancer patients.	In many gastric cancer patients, the disease is diagnosed in an advanced stage and therefore the mortality levels are high. Because there is a need to identify novel early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, we tested whether SIRT1 and STAT3 are good candidates. Towards this, we used patient tissues representing different stages of gastric cancer including gastric pre-cancerous lesions, early gastric cancer, and advanced gastric cancer, and probed SIRT1, STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) levels using immunohistochemistry. Our results revealed upregulated expression of SIRT1 in all stages of gastric cancer compared with noncancerous gastric mucosa, suggesting that high SIRT1 levels are likely involved in establishing gastric neoplasticity. However, STAT3 and pSTAT3 levels remained low until the gastric mucosa reached the tumor stage. Moreover, co-ordinated high expression of SIRT1 and STAT3 predicted poor overall survival for advanced gastric cancer patients. In addition, through analysis of gastric cancer patients from the TCGA dataset, we identified SIRT2 as an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer patients. We postulate that SIRT1 and STAT3 are potential early diagnostic and prognostic markers of gastric cancer. Our study also shows that SIRT1 acts a gatekeeper during gastric tumorigenesis.	association	1
28061479	MiR-24 induces chemotherapy resistance and hypoxic advantage in breast cancer.	Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer mortality among women. It has been proved that the onset of cancer depends on a very small pool of tumor cells with a phenotype similar to that of normal adult stem cells. Cancer stem cells (CSC) possess self-renewal and multilineage differentiation potential as well as a robust ability to sustain tumorigenesis. Evidence suggests that CSCs contribute to chemotherapy resistance and to survival under hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, hypoxia in turn regulates self-renewal in CSCs and these effects may be primarily mediated by hypoxic inducible factors (HIFs). Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical players in the maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal in normal and cancer stem cells. Here, we demonstrate that miR-24 is upregulated in breast CSCs and that its overexpression increases the number of mammospheres and the expression of stem cell markers. MiR-24 also induces apoptosis resistance through the regulation of BimL expression. Moreover, we identify a new miR-24 target, FIH1, which promotes HIFα degradation: miR-24 increases under hypoxic conditions, causing downregulation of FIH1 and upregulation of HIF1α. In conclusion, miR-24 hampers chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in breast CSCs and increases cell resistance to hypoxic conditions through an FIH1-HIFα pathway.	association	1
28061478	Mitotic control of human papillomavirus genome-containing cells is regulated by the function of the PDZ-binding motif of the E6 oncoprotein.	The function of a conserved PDS95/DLG1/ZO1 (PDZ) binding motif (E6 PBM) at the C-termini of E6 oncoproteins of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types contributes to the development of HPV-associated malignancies. Here, using a primary human keratinocyte-based model of the high-risk HPV18 life cycle, we identify a novel link between the E6 PBM and mitotic stability. In cultures containing a mutant genome in which the E6 PBM was deleted there was an increase in the frequency of abnormal mitoses, including multinucleation, compared to cells harboring the wild type HPV18 genome. The loss of the E6 PBM was associated with a significant increase in the frequency of mitotic spindle defects associated with anaphase and telophase. Furthermore, cells carrying this mutant genome had increased chromosome segregation defects and they also exhibited greater levels of genomic instability, as shown by an elevated level of centromere-positive micronuclei. In wild type HPV18 genome-containing organotypic cultures, the majority of mitotic cells reside in the suprabasal layers, in keeping with the hyperplastic morphology of the structures. However, in mutant genome-containing structures a greater proportion of mitotic cells were retained in the basal layer, which were often of undefined polarity, thus correlating with their reduced thickness. We conclude that the ability of E6 to target cellular PDZ proteins plays a critical role in maintaining mitotic stability of HPV infected cells, ensuring stable episome persistence and vegetative amplification.

28061477	Autocrine VEGF signaling promotes cell proliferation through a PLC-dependent pathway and modulates Apatinib treatment efficacy in gastric cancer.	BACKGROUND: Tumor cells produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which interact with the membrane or cytoplasmic VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) to promote cell growth in an angiogenesis-independent fashion. Apatinib, a highly selective VEGFR2 inhibitor, is the only effective drug for patients with terminal gastric cancer (GC) who have no other chemotherapeutic options. However, its treatment efficacy is still controversy and the mechanism behind remains undetermined. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of autocrine VEGF signaling in the growth of gastric cancer cells and the efficacy of Apatinib treatment.METHODS: The expression of phosphor VEGFR2 in gastric cancer cell lines was determined by real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot. The gastric cancer cells were administrated with or without recombination human VEGF (rhVEGF), VEGFR2 neutralizing antibody, U73122, SU1498, and Apatinib. The nude mice were used for xenograft tumor model.RESULTS: we found that autocrine VEGF induced high VEGFR2-expression, promoted phosphorylation of VEGFR2, and further enhanced internalization of pVEGFR2 in gastric cancer cells. The autocrine VEGF was self-sustained through increasing VEGF mRNA and protein expression. It exerted pro-proliferative effect through a PLC-ERK1/2 dependent pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrated that in VEGFR2 overexpressing gastric cancer cells, Apatinib inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and delayed xenograft tumor growth in vivo. However, these effects were not observed in VEGFR2 low expressing gastric cancer cells.CONCLUSION: These results suggested that autocrine VEGF signaling promotes gastric cancer cell proliferation and enhances Apatinib treatment outcome in VEGFR2 overexpression gastric cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. This study would enable better stratification of gastric cancer patients for clinical treatment decision.	therapeutic	1
28061476	MiR-675-5p supports hypoxia induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition in colon cancer cells.	The survival rates in colon cancer patients are inversely proportional to the number of lymph node metastases. The hypoxia-induced Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), driven by HIF1α, is known to be involved in cancer progression and metastasis. Recently, we have reported that miR-675-5p promotes glioma growth by stabilizing HIF1α; here, by use of the syngeneic cell lines we investigated the role of the miR-675-5p in colon cancer metastasis.Our results show that miR-675-5p, over expressed in metastatic colon cancer cells, participates to tumour progression by regulating HIF1α induced EMT. MiR-675-5p increases Snail transcription by a dual strategy: i) stabilizing the activity of the transcription factor HIF1α and ii) and inhibiting Snail's repressor DDB2 (Damage specific DNA Binding protein 2).Moreover, transcriptional analyses on specimens from colon cancer patients confirmed, in vivo, the correlation between miR-675-5p over-expression and metastasis, thus identifying miR-675-5p as a new marker for colon cancer progression and therefore a putative target for therapeutic strategies.

28061475	Potential roles of microRNAs and ROS in colorectal cancer: diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.	As one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide, colorectal adenocarcinoma often occurs sporadically in individuals aged 50 or above and there is an increase among younger patients under 50. Routine screenings are recommended for this age group to improve early detection. The multifactorial etiology of colorectal cancer consists of both genetic and epigenetic factors. Recently, studies have shown that the development and progression of colorectal cancer can be attributed to aberrant expression of microRNA. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a key role in cancer cell survival, can also lead to carcinogenesis and cancer exacerbations. Given the rapid accumulating knowledge in the field, an updated review regarding microRNA and ROS in colorectal cancer is necessary. An extensive literature search has been conducted in PubMed/Medline databases to review the roles of microRNAs and ROS in colorectal cancer. Unique microRNA expression in tumor tissue, peripheral blood, and fecal samples from patients with colorectal cancer is outlined. Therapeutic approaches focusing on microRNA and ROS in colorectal cancer treatment is also delineated. This review aims to summarize the newest knowledge on the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer in the hopes of discovering novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic techniques.	NA	2
28061474	Tomotherapy as an adjuvant treatment for gastroesophageal junction and stomach cancer may reduce bowel and bone marrow toxicity compared to intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc therapy.	PURPOSE: To compare dosimetric parameters of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and tomotherapy (TOMO) in the adjuvant treatment of gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)/stomach cancer. The planning goal was to maintain high target coverage while keeping the dose to the bowel and bone marrow (BM) as low as possible.MATERIALS AND METHODS: After curative surgery, 16 patients with GEJ/stomach cancer were re-planned by coplanar IMRT (five fixed beam), VMAT (double-arc), and TOMO. The dose to the planning target volume (PTV) was 45 Gy in 25 fractions. The target parameters, including the homogeneity index (HI) and conformity index (CI), and doses to the organs at risk (OARs) were analyzed.RESULTS: Dosimetric parameters for PTV and OARs were comparable among the three techniques. However, TOMO provided improved conformity (CI = 0.92±0.03) and homogeneity (HI = 1.07±0.02) than IMRT (CI = 0.87±0.03; HI = 1.09±0.02; p &lt; 0.05) and VMAT (CI = 0.86±0.03; HI = 1.09±0.02; p &lt; 0.01). TOMO also improved dose sparing of the bowel (percentage of the volume receiving a dose of ≥ 30 Gy [V30] = 23.24±9.85) and BM (V30 = 71.66±6.15) compared with IMRT (bowel V30 = 30.02±11.74; BM V30 = 83.74±8.42; p &lt; 0.01) and VMAT (bowel V30 = 31.88±11.59; BM V30 = 79.51±9.07; p &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: TOMO is a good option for adjuvant treatment of GEJ/stomach cancer in patients undergoing radical surgery due to its superior bowel and BM dose sparing, dose conformity and dose homogeneity; however, future studies are required to validate its clinical efficacy.

28061473	Immunotherapy: incorporation in the evolving paradigm of renal cancer management and future prospects.	Significant progress has been made in the management of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) during the last few decades. In early stage, localized disease, surgical resection remains the modality of choice, with no therapeutic interventions as options for post-operative therapy other than simple observation and clinical surveillance. However, treatment options in the advanced or metastatic setting are increasing at a dizzying pace, initially with cytokine therapy, then with the increased availability of targeted therapy including novel small-molecule inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases and monoclonal antibodies targeting novel proteins, establishing them as the current standard of care. Even more recently, immunotherapy has seen tremendous development in the form of immune checkpoint inhibition and vaccines. Overall, these interventions have gradually changed the landscape of cancer management in general, and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) in particular. This is exemplified by the recent United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approval of nivolumab for patients with mRCC after failure of TKI therapy. In this review, we present a brief overview of the current management of mRCC, primarily the clear cell subtype (ccRCC), and discuss the major clinical trials and data on the immunotherapy in advanced or mRCC.

28061472	Harms and benefits of adoptive immunotherapy for postoperative hepatocellular carcinoma: an updated review.	The harms and benefits of adoptive immunotherapy (AIT) for patients with postoperative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are controversial among studies. This study aims to update the current evidence on efficacy and safety of AIT for patients with HCC who have received curative therapy. Electronic databases were systematically searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies evaluating adjuvant AIT for patients with HCC after curative therapies. Recurrence and mortality were compared between patients with or without adjuvant AIT. Eight RCTs and two cohort studies involving 2,120 patients met the eligibility criteria and were meta-analyzed. Adjuvant AIT was associated with significantly lower recurrence rate than curative therapies alone at 1 year [risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95%CI 0.49-0.82], 3 years (RR 0.85, 95%CI 0.79-0.91) and 5 years (RR 0.90, 95%CI 0.85-0.95). Similarly, adjuvant AIT was associated with significantly lower mortality at 1 year (RR 0.64, 95%CI 0.52-0.79), 3 years (RR 0.73, 95%CI 0.65-0.81) and 5 years (RR 0.86, 95%CI 0.79-0.94). Short-term outcomes were confirmed in sensitivity analyses based on RCTs or choice of a fixed- or random-effect meta-analysis model. None of the included patients experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse events. Therefore, this update reinforces the evidence that adjuvant AIT after curative treatment for HCC lowers risk of recurrence and mortality.	NA	0
28061471	Transformation to small-cell carcinoma as an acquired resistance mechanism to AZD9291: A case report.	AZD9291, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), benefits patients with T790M mutant non-small-cell lung cancer who fail treatment with first-generation EGFR TKIs. Acquisition of resistance to AZD9291 occurs inevitable and mechanisms need to be explored. We reported an advanced lung adenocarcinoma female with EGFR exon19 deletion treated on AZD9291 after failure of erlotinib and chemotherapy. Disease progressed again after 6 months' treatment of AZD9291 with hepatic metastasis. Re-biopsy of the hepatic lesion showed histopathology transformation to small cell lung cancer, which harbored EGFR exon19 deletion. Therefore, small cell carcinoma transformation is one of potential resistance mechanisms to AZD9291 and regimen for small cell carcinoma may be one of the treatment options.	NA	2
28061470	Lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: From a clinical perspective.	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer are devastating pulmonary diseases that commonly coexist and present a number of clinical challenges. COPD confers a higher risk for lung cancer development, but available chemopreventive measures remain rudimentary. Current studies have shown a marked benefit of cancer screening in the COPD population, although challenges remain, including the common underdiagnosis of COPD. COPD-associated lung cancer presents distinct clinical features. Treatment for lung cancer coexisting with COPD is challenging as COPD may increase postoperative morbidities and decrease survival. In this review, we outline current progress in the understanding of the clinical association between COPD and lung cancer, and suggest possible cancer prevention strategies in this patient population.

28061469	Diagnosis of cytomegalovirus pneumonia by quantitative polymerase chain reaction using bronchial washing fluid from patients with hematologic malignancies.	BACKGROUND: The incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia is increasing in patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies. The utility of CMV-DNA viral load measurement has not been standardized, and viral cut-off values have not been established. This study was designed to investigate the utility of CMV quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using bronchial washing fluid.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the microbiologic and pathologic results of bronchial washing fluid and biopsy specimens in addition to the patients' clinical characteristics.RESULTS: A total of 565 CMV qRT-PCR assays were performed using bronchial washing fluid from patients with hematologic malignancies. Among them, 101 were positive for CMV by qRT-PCR; of these, 24 were diagnosed with CMV pneumonia and 70 with CMV infection, and 7 were excluded due to a diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis rather than viral pneumonia. The median CMV load determined by qPCR was 1.8 × 105 copies/mL (3.6 103-1.5 × 108) in CMV pneumonia patients and 3.0 × 103 copies/mL (5.0 × 102-1.1 × 105) in those diagnosed with CMV infection (P &lt; 0.01). Using the ROC curve, the optimal inflection points were 18,900 copies/mL (137,970 IU/mL) in post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients, 316,415 copies/mL (2,309,825 IU/mL) in no-BMT patients and 28,774 copies/mL (210,054 IU/mL) in all patients.CONCLUSIONS: The CMV titers in bronchial washing fluid determined by qRT-PCR differed significantly between patients diagnosed with CMV pneumonia and those with CMV infection. The viral cut-off values in bronchial washing fluid were suggested for the diagnosis of CMV pneumonia, which were different depending on the BMT status.	NA	0
28061468	The heterogeneous landscape of ALK negative ALCL.	Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) is a clinical and biological heterogeneous disease including systemic ALK positive and ALK negative entities. Whereas ALK positive ALCLs are molecularly characterized and readily diagnosed, specific immunophenotypic or genetic features to define ALK negative ALCL are missing, and their distinction from other T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (T-NHLs) can be controversial. In recent years, great advances have been made in dissecting the heterogeneity of ALK negative ALCLs and in providing new diagnostic and treatment options for these patients. A new revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification promoted ALK negative ALCL to a definite entity that includes cytogenetic subsets with prognostic implications. However, a further understanding of the genetic landscape of ALK negative ALCL is required to dictate more effective therapeutic strategies specifically tailored for each subgroup of patients.	NA	2
28061466	Prostate cancer proteomics: Current trends and future perspectives for biomarker discovery.	The clinical and fundamental research in prostate cancer - the most common urological cancer in men - is currently entering the proteomic and genomic era. The focus has switched from one single marker (PSA) to panels of biomarkers (including proteins involved in ribosomal function and heat shock proteins). Novel genetic markers (such as Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-ERG fusion gene mRNA) or prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) had already entered the clinical practice, raising the question whether subsequent protein changes impact the evolution of the disease and the response to treatment. Proteomic technologies such as MALDI-MS, SELDI-MS, i-TRAQ allow a qualitative/quantitative analysis of the proteome variations, in both serum and tumor tissue. A new trend in prostate cancer research is proteomic analysis of prostasomes (prostate-specific exosomes), for the discovery of new biomarkers. This paper provides an update of novel clinical tests used in research and clinical diagnostic, as well as of potential tissue or fluid biomarkers provided by extensive proteomic research data.	NA	2
28061465	SIRPα-antibody fusion proteins stimulate phagocytosis and promote elimination of acute myeloid leukemia cells.	CD47, expressed on a variety of tumor cells, confers immune resistance by delivering an inhibitory &quot;don't eat me&quot; signal to phagocytic cells via its myeloid-specific receptor SIRPα. Recent studies have shown that blocking the CD47-SIRPα axis with CD47-directed antibodies or antibody-derivatives enhances phagocytosis and increases antitumor immune effects. However, CD47 expression on healthy cells creates an antigen sink and potential sites of toxicity, limiting the efficacy of CD47-directed therapies. In this study, we first characterized CD47 expression in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients (n = 213) and found that CD47 is highly expressed on both AML bulk and stem cells irrespective of the disease state. Furthermore, to inhibit the CD47-SIRPα signaling pathway at the tumor site, we developed a so-called local inhibitory checkpoint monoclonal antibody (licMAB) by grafting the endogenous SIRPα domain to the N-terminus of the light chain of an antibody targeting CD33, a surface antigen expressed in AML. LicMABs selectively bind CD33-expressing cells even in the presence of a large CD33-negative CD47-positive antigen sink, stimulate phagocytosis of AML cells and eliminate AML cell lines and primary, patient-derived AML cells. Our findings qualify licMABs as a promising therapeutic approach to confine the benefit of disrupting the CD47-SIRPα axis to tumor antigen-expressing cells.	NA	0
28061464	MET receptor variant R970C favors calpain-dependent generation of a fragment promoting epithelial cell scattering.	The receptor tyrosine kinase MET and its ligand, the hepatocyte growth factor, are essential to embryonic development, whereas deregulation of MET signaling is associated with tumorigenesis leading to various cancers, including lung carcinoma. Mutations in the MET kinase domain lead to constitutive kinase activity and are associated with tumorigenesis. In lung cancer, however, some mutations are found in the juxtamembrane domain, and their functional consequences are unknown. Because the juxtamembrane domain of MET is targeted by several proteolytic cleavages, involved in its degradation during cell death or under steady-state conditions, we evaluated the influence of these mutations on the MET proteolytic cleavages. In stably transfected epithelial cells expressing MET, the juxtamembrane mutations R970C, P991S, and T992I were found not to modify the known caspase or presenilin-dependent regulated intramembrane proteolysis. Yet when overexpressed, the R970C variant caused generation of an as yet undescribed 45-kDa fragment (p45 MET). This fragment was found in the confluent lung cancer cell line NCI-H1437 carrying the R970C mutation and at a lesser extent in cell lines expressing WT MET, suggesting that R970C mutation favors this cleavage. Generation of p45 MET required the activity of the calpain proteases, confirming the involvement of proteolysis. Ectopic expression of reconstituted p45 MET in epithelial cell lines favored cell scattering and invasion indicating active role of this fragment in HGF/SF induced responses. Hence, although the juxtamembrane mutations of MET do not affect its known proteolytic cleavages, the R970C MET variant favors calpain dependent proteolytic cleavage in lung cancer cells.	NA	2
28061461	Estimation of cell-free circulating EGFR mutation concentration predicts outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with EGFR-TKIs.	Detection of circulating tumor DNA using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a highly-sensitive, minimally invasive alternative to serial biopsies for assessment and management of cancer. We used ddPCR to assess the utility of measuring plasma concentrations of common epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (L858R, exon 19 deletion, and T790M) in 57 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). High baseline plasma EGFR mutation (pEGFRmut) concentrations were associated with shorter progression-free survival (8.43 months) than low baseline pEGFRmut (16.23 months; p = 0.0019). By contrast, there were no differences in tumor shrinkage or overall survival between groups. During EGFR-TKI treatment, pEGFRmut levels decreased to zero in 89.58% of patients. Twenty-five of the 27 patients who progressed had basal pEGFRmut, and 18 also had circulating T790M. All 20 patients with dramatic progression (according to a categorization system for EGFR-TKIs failure) had basal pEGFRmut, and 13 had T790M mutation at progression. These results support the use of ddPCR for analysis of plasma EGFR mutations for prediction of PFS and to monitor clinical responses to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients.	NA	2
28061460	L1 increases adhesion-mediated proliferation and chemoresistance of retinoblastoma.	Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular cancer in children, affecting 1/20,000 live births. Currently, children with retinoblastoma were treated with chemotherapy using drugs such as carboplatin, vincristine, and etoposide. Unfortunately, if conventional treatment fails, the affected eyes should be removed to prevent extension into adjacent tissues and metastasis. This study is to investigate the roles of L1 in adhesion-mediated proliferation and chemoresistance of retinoblastoma. L1 was differentially expressed in 30 retinoblastoma tissues and 2 retinoblastoma cell lines. Furthermore, the proportions of L1-positive cells in retinoblastoma tumors were negatively linked with the number of Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes, a characteristic of differentiated retinoblastoma tumors, in each tumor sample. Following in vitro experiments using L1-deleted and -overexpressing cells showed that L1 increased adhesion-mediated proliferation of retinoblastoma cells via regulation of cell cycle-associated proteins with modulation of Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p38 pathways. In addition, L1 increased resistance against carboplatin, vincristine, and esoposide through up-regulation of apoptosis- and multidrug resistance-related genes. In vivo tumor formation and chemoresistance were also positively linked with the levels of L1 in an orthotopic transplantation model in mice. In this manner, L1 increases adhesion-mediated proliferation and chemoresistance of retinoblastoma. Targeted therapy to L1 might be effective in the treatment of retinoblastoma tumors, especially which rapidly proliferate and demonstrate resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs.	NA	0
28061458	Oncometabolite succinate promotes angiogenesis by upregulating VEGF expression through GPR91-mediated STAT3 and ERK activation.	Altered cellular metabolism is now generally acknowledged as a hallmark of cancer cells, the resultant abnormal oncometabolites cause both metabolic and nonmetabolic dysregulation and potential transformation to malignancy. A subset of cancers have been found to be associated with mutations in succinate dehydrogenase genes which result in the accumulation of succinate. However, the function of succinate in tumorigenesis remains unclear. In the present study, we aim to investigate the role of oncometabolite succinate in tumor angiogenesis. Our data demonstrated the accumulation of markedly elevated succinate in gastric cancer tissues compared with that in paracancerous tissues. Moreover, succinate was able to increase the chemotactic motility, tube-like structure formation and proliferation of primary human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (pHUVECs) in vitro, as well as promoting the blood vessel formation in transgenic zebrafish. Our mechanistic studies reveal that succinate upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression by activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 via its receptor GPR91 in a HIF-1α independent mechanism. Taken together, these data indicate an important role of the succinate-GPR91 axis in tumor angiogenesis, which may enable development of a novel therapeutic strategy that targets cancer metabolism.

28061457	Prognostic roles of mRNA expression of notch receptors in non-small cell lung cancer.	Notch signalling is aberrantly activated in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, the prognostic roles of mRNA expression of four Notch receptors in NSCLC patients remain elusive. In this report, we reported the prognostic roles of Notch receptors in a total of 1,926 NSCLC patients through &quot;The Kaplan-Meier plotter&quot; (KM plotter) database which is capable to assess the effect of 22,277 genes on survival of NSCLC patients. We found that mRNA high expression level of Notch1 was associated with better overall survival (OS) for all NSCLC patients, hazard ratio (HR) 0.78 (0.69-0.89), p=0.00019, better OS in adenocarcinoma (Ade) patients, HR 0.59 (0.46-0.75), p=1.5e-05, as well as in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients, HR 0.78 (0.62-0.99), p=0.044. mRNA high expression levels of Notch2 and Notch3 were associated with worsen OS for all NSCLC patients, as well as in Ade, but not in SCC patients. mRNA high expression level of Notch4 was not found to be associated with to OS for all NSCLC patients. In addition, mRNA high expression levels of Notch2, Notch3, but Notch4 are significantly associated with the NSCLC patients who have different smoking status. Our results indicate that mRNA expression of Notch receptors may have distinct prognostic values in NSCLC patients. These results will benefit for developing tools to accurately predict the prognosis of NSCLC patients.	prognostic	1
28061456	Vitamin D receptor polymorphisms or serum levels as key drivers of breast cancer development? The question of the vitamin D pathway.	As total vitamin D levels are often lower in black than in white Americans, the former are frequently classified as vitamin D-deficient. To fully understand African vitamin D (25(OH)D) status, other factors should be considered, e.g. vitamin D blood carrier, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), vitamin D receptor (VDR) and DBP polymorphisms. A prospective study on an indigenous black Tanzanian and a Caucasian Italian population was performed on 50 healthy donors from both populations and 35 Caucasian and 18 African breast cancer patients. 25(OH)D and DBP serum levels were analyzed by ELISA. A1012G, Cdx2 and Fok1 VDR polymorphisms and DBP polymorphisms rs4588 and rs7041 were genotyped by real-time PCR. Vitamin D and DBP levels were lower in healthy African donors than in Caucasians. Africans had a significantly higher frequency of AA and CC for Cdx2 and Fok1 polymorphisms, respectively. These allelic variants were related to a higher transcription of VDR gene and a higher activity of VDR receptor. With regard to polymorphism distribution, Africans showed innate higher levels and activity of VDR. We conclude that a strengthening of the vitamin D pathway could have a protective role against the development of breast cancer in the African population.	NA	2
28061455	Enhancement of the bioavailability of a novel anticancer compound (acetyltanshinone IIA) by encapsulation within mPEG-PLGA nanoparticles: a study of formulation optimization, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics.	The Poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether-block-poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (mPEG-PLGA) nanoparticles carrying acetyltanshinone IIA (ATA), a novel anti-breast cancer agent, were prepared by ultrasonic emulsion method to enhance the bioavailability and reduce the toxicity. Systematic optimization of encapsulation process was achieved using an orthogonal design. Drug efficacy analysis showed that ATA nanoparticles were as effective as free ATA against estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells, but much less toxic towards human endothelial cells. Furthermore, in zebrafish, ATA nanoparticles displayed much lower toxicity than free ATA. More importantly, the blood concentration of ATA nanoparticles indicated by 24 hour-area under the curve (AUC0-24h) was 10 times higher than free ATA. These results indicated the potential of ATA-loaded mPEG-PLGA nanoparticles for the delivery of ATA in a clinical formulation, and their potential for use in tumor therapy in the future.	NA	0
28061454	Cell type- and density-dependent effect of 1 T static magnetic field on cell proliferation.	Increasing evidence shows that static magnetic fields (SMFs) can affect cell proliferation but mixed results have been reported. Here we systematically examined the effects of 1 T (Tesla) SMF, which is close to the SMF intensity that patients are exposed to MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanners in hospitals, for its effect on 15 different cell lines, including 12 human and 3 rodent cell lines. Our results show that 1 T SMF does not have apparent impact on cell cycle or cell death. However, at higher cell density, it reduced cell numbers in six out of seven solid human cancer cell lines. We found that both cell type and cell density had evident impacts on SMF effects. Moreover, the EGFR-Akt-mTOR pathway, which varies significantly between different cell types and densities, contributes to the differential effects of SMF. In addition, SMF also increases the efficacy of Akt inhibitors on cancer cell growth inhibition. Therefore 1 T SMF affects cell proliferation in a cell type- and cell density-dependent manner, and the inhibition effect of 1 T SMF on multiple cancer cells at higher cell density may indicate its clinical potential in late stage cancer therapy.

28061453	The regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) inhibits nuclear factor kappaB signaling pathway and suppresses human malignant glioma cells growth.	Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) has a vital role in cell survival and inhibition of NF-κB had proven to be an efficient therapeutic pathway for various cancers though little is known about the underlying mechanism. Previously we identified regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) as an endogenous inhibitor of NF-κB signaling pathway in lymphoma. In the present study, we have solid data to show that RCAN1 can inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-κB protein then affect the activity of NF-κB signaling pathway in glioma cells. Overexpression of RCAN1 markedly reduced glioma cells viability. We further found that the suppressing glioma cell growth was closely related to the pro-apoptosis effect, not by inhibiting proliferation by the arrest of cell cycle. Our study implicated a novel therapeutic approach for glioma by RCAN1 through inhibition of NF-κB signaling.	NA	0
28061451	Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel as neoadjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: The value of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) in neoadjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer remains uncertain.METHODS: Both electronic databases and proceedings of oncologic meetings were included in systematic literature search. Pooled rates of pathological complete response (pCR), odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed-effect or random-effect model to determine the effect of neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel.RESULTS: Twenty-one studies with 2357 patients were included, 3 of which were randomized clinical trials. The aggregate pCR(ypT0/is ypN0) rate was 32% (95% CI 25-38%) in unselected breast cancer patients and variated in different subtypes. Within randomized clinical trials, the probability of achieving pCR was significantly higher in the nab-paclitaxel group than in the conventional taxanes group (OR = 1.383, 95%CI 1.141-1.676, p = 0.001). For non-hematological toxic effect, any grade and grade 3-4 peripheral sensory neuropathy occurred more frequently with nab-paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel (any grade, OR = 2.090, 95%CI 1.016-4.302, p = 0.045; grade3-4, OR = 3.766, 95%CI 2.324-6.100, p &lt; 0.001). Hypersensitivity was more common with paclitaxel than nab-paclitaxel at any grade and grade 3-4.CONCLUSION: nab-paclitaxel is an effective cytotoxic drug in neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer, especially for aggressive tumors in terms of pCR. Exchange of nab-paclitaxel for conventional taxanes could significantly improve pCR rate with reasonable toxicities.	NA	0
28061450	Th1high in tumor microenvironment is an indicator of poor prognosis for patients with NSCLC.	CD4+Th subsets play an important role in tumor progression but their expression characteristics and clinical significance in human tumor microenvironment remains unclear. In this study, we aim to analyze the expression and clinical significance of tissue-infiltrating Th1, Th2 and Th17 in lung cancer by flow cytometry. We found that the frequency of CD3+CD4+IFN-γ+Th1 in tumor nest was significantly lower than that in tumor boundary, adjacent normal lung tissue or corresponding lymph node tissue; the frequency of CD3+CD4+IL-4+Th2 in tumor nest was significantly higher than that in tumor boundary, adjacent normal lung tissue or corresponding lymph node tissue; the frequency of CD3+CD4+IL-17+Th17 in tumor nest was significantly lower than that in tumor boundary, but not adjacent normal tissue or corresponding lymph node tissue. Survival analysis of 2-years survival after surgery showed that Th1high group was significantly lower compared with Th1low group; Th2high and Th17low is a good prognosis index compared with the Th2low and Th17high groups respectively, but this difference failed to significance. In addition, we also found that PD-1 expression showed a high level on lung tumor tissues and adjacent non- tumor tissue infiltrating T cells, and no significant difference was found between the two groups. However PD-L1 on CD45+CD14+mononcytes/macrophages in tumor tissue show a significantly higher level compared with that in adjacent nontumor tissues. In vitro stimulation experiments showed that IFN-γ could significantly increase PD-L1 expression on monocyte. In conclusion, we for the first time found Th1high is a poor indicator for prognosis of lung cancer.	NA	0
28061449	Central spindle proteins and mitotic kinesins are direct transcriptional targets of MuvB, B-MYB and FOXM1 in breast cancer cell lines and are potential targets for therapy.	The MuvB multiprotein complex, together with B-MYB and FOXM1 (MMB-FOXM1), plays an essential role in cell cycle progression by regulating the transcription of genes required for mitosis and cytokinesis. In many tumors, B-MYB and FOXM1 are overexpressed as part of the proliferation signature. However, the transcriptional targets that are important for oncogenesis have not been identified. Given that mitotic kinesins are highly expressed in cancer cells and that selected kinesins have been reported as target genes of MMB-FOXM1, we sought to determine which mitotic kinesins are directly regulated by MMB-FOXM1. We demonstrate that six mitotic kinesins and two microtubule-associated non-motor proteins (MAPs) CEP55 and PRC1 are direct transcriptional targets of MuvB, B-MYB and FOXM1 in breast cancer cells. Suppression of KIF23 and PRC1 strongly suppressed proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. The set of MMB-FOXM1 regulated kinesins genes and 4 additional kinesins which we referred to as the mitotic kinesin signature (MKS) is linked to poor outcome in breast cancer patients. Thus, mitotic kinesins could be used as prognostic biomarker and could be potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of breast cancer.	NA	0
28061448	Targeting basal-like breast tumors with bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) and polo-like kinase inhibitors.	Metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an incurable disease with limited therapeutic options, and no targeted therapies available. Triple negative tumors and the basal-like genomic subtype, are both characterized by a high proliferation rate and an increase in cell division. In this context, protein kinases involved in the mitotic formation have a relevant role in this tumor subtype. Recently, Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitors have shown to be active in this disease by modulating the expression of several transcription factors. In this article, by using an &quot;in silico&quot; approach, we identified genomic functions that can be inhibited pharmacologically in basal-like tumors. Functional annotation analyses identified &quot;cell division&quot; and &quot;regulation of transcription&quot; as upregulated functions. When focus on cell division, we identified the polo-like kinase 1 (PLK) as an upregulated kinase. The PLK inhibitor Volasertib had the strongest anti-proliferative effect compared with other inhibitors against mitotic kinases. Gene expression analyses demonstrated that the BET inhibitor JQ1 reduced the expression of kinases involved in cell division, and synergized with Volasertib in a panel of triple negative cell lines. Combination of both agents augmented cell death. Similarly, combination of both compounds reduced the expression of stem cell markers. Globally, this data demonstrates the synergistic interaction between BET and PLK inhibitors, paving the way for their future clinical development.	NA	0
28061447	The combination effect of homoharringtonine and ibrutinib on FLT3-ITD mutant acute myeloid leukemia.	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous disease and internal tandem duplication mutation in FMS-like tyrosine-kinase-3 (FLT3-ITD) has a negative impact on outcome. Finding effective treatment regimens is desperately needed. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effect and mechanism of homoharringtonine (HHT) in combination with ibrutinib on FLT3-ITD mutant AML cells. Consequently, we observed a synergistic inhibitory effect when ibrutinib was combined with HHT to inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis and arrest cell cycle at G0/G1 phase in MV4-11 and MOLM-13 leukemia cells. Our results indicate that the mechanisms of the combination effect are mainly via regulating the STAT5/Pim-2/C-Myc pathway, AKT pathway and Bcl-2 family, activating p21WAF1/CIP1 and inhibiting CCND/CDK complex protein. Interestingly, synergistic cytotoxicity of ibrutinib and HHT was dependent on both FLT3 and BTK. Here we provide a novel effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation.	therapeutic	1
28061445	The clinical significance and underlying correlation of pStat-3 and integrin αvβ6 expression in gallbladder cancer.	BACKGROUND: Both phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3(pStat-3) and integrin αvβ6 can play vital role in the development and progression of cancer. However, little is known about their expression correlation and clinical significance in gallbladder cancer(GBC).OBJECTIVE: The aim of our present study was to investigate the expression of pStat-3 and integrin αvβ6, two proteins' correlation and their clinical significance in GBC tissues.RESULTS: The expression of pStat-3 and integrin αvβ6 were both significantly associated with T stage, lymph node metastasis status, TNM stage (P=0.008, P=0.000, P=0.000 and P=0.036, P=0.001,P=0.000,respectively). IHC and Western blot showed their expressions in GBC tissues were higher than that in paraneoplastic tissues. Moderate positive correlation existed between the two proteins (r =0.349, P &lt;0.001). The survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression model showed that GBC patients with pStat-3 or integrin αvβ6 positive expression had a significantly poorer 2-year survival rate (P = 0.002 and 0.000, the log-rank test, respectively), and either marker could act as unfavorable independent prognostic factors(RR=1.907, P=0.021 and RR=2.046, P=0.038).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression levels of pStat-3 and integrin αvβ6 were analyzed in GBC cancerous and paraneoplastic tissues of 97 cases via immunohistochemistry(IHC) and further validated by western blot method. Besides, SPSS software was used to observe their clinical significance as well as the two proteins' correlation.CONCLUSION: pStat-3 and integrin αvβ6 were indicators of tumor's progression and poor prognosis of patients with GBC. And the further study involving them may provide a helpful therapeutic target in prevention and treatment of GBC patients.	NA	2
28061443	MHY1485 ameliorates UV-induced skin cell damages via activating mTOR-Nrf2 signaling.	Ultra Violet (UV)-caused skin cell damage is a main cause of skin cancer. Here, we studied the activity of MHY1485, a mTOR activator, in UV-treated skin cells. In primary human skin keratinocytes, HaCaT keratinocytes and human skin fibroblasts, MHY1485 ameliorated UV-induced cell death and apoptosis. mTOR activation is required for MHY1485-induced above cytoprotective actions. mTOR kinase inhibitors (OSI-027, AZD-8055 and AZD-2014) or mTOR shRNA knockdown almost abolished MHY1485-induced cytoprotection. Further, MHY1485 treatment in skin cells activated mTOR downstream NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling, causing Nrf2 Ser-40 phosphorylation, stabilization/upregulation and nuclear translocation, as well as mRNA expression of Nrf2-dictated genes. Contrarily, Nrf2 knockdown or S40T mutation almost nullified MHY1485-induced cytoprotection. MHY1485 suppressed UV-induced reactive oxygen species production and DNA single strand breaks in skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Together, we conclude that MHY1485 inhibits UV-induced skin cell damages via activating mTOR-Nrf2 signaling.	NA	0

The TGF-β signaling pathway is involved in regulation of cell growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. We test the hypothesis that genetic variation in the TGF-β signaling pathway alters miRNA expression.We use data from 1188 colorectal cancer cases to evaluate associations between 80 SNPs in 21 genes.Seven variants eIF4E rs12498533, NFκB1 rs230510, TGFB1 rs4803455, TGFBR1 rs1571590 and rs6478974, SMAD3 rs3743343, and RUNX1 rs8134179 were associated with expression level of miRNAs in normal colorectal mucosa. RUNX2 rs12333172 and BMPR1B rs13134042 were associated with miRNAs in normal colon mucosa; eIF4EBP3 rs250425, SMAD3 rs12904944, SMAD7 rs3736242, and PTEN rs532678 were associated with miRNA expression in normal rectal mucosa. Evaluation of the differential expression between carcinoma and normal mucosa showed that SMAD3 rs12708491 and rs2414937, NFκB1 rs230510 and rs3821958, and RUNX3 rs6672420 were associated with several miRNAs for colorectal carcinoma. Evaluation of site-specific differential miRNA expression showed that BMPR1B rs2120834, BMPR2 rs2228545, and eIF4EBP3 rs250425 were associated with differential miRNA expression in colon tissue and SMAD3 rs12901071, rs1498506, and rs2414937, BMPR2 rs2228545, and RUNX2 rs2819854, altered differential miRNA expression in rectal tissue.These data support the importance of the TGF-β signaling pathway to the carcinogenic process, possibly through their influence on miRNA expression levels.

28061441	Activation of TRPM7 by naltriben enhances migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells.	Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive brain tumor in the central nervous system, remains a lethal diagnosis with a median survival of &lt; 15 months. Aberrant expression of the TRPM7 channel has been linked to GBM functions. In this study, using the human GBM cell line U87, we evaluated the TRPM7 activator naltriben on GBM viability, migration, and invasiveness. First, using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, we showed that naltriben enhanced the endogenous TRPM7-like current in U87 cells. In addition, with Fura-2 Ca2+ imaging, we observed robust Ca2+ influx following naltriben application. Naltriben significantly enhanced U87 cell migration and invasion (assessed with scratch wound assays, Matrigel invasion experiments, and MMP-2 protein expression), but not viability and proliferation (evaluated with MTT assays). Using Western immunoblots, we also detected the protein levels of p-Akt/t-Akt, and p-ERK1|2/t-ERK1|2. We found that naltriben enhanced the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, but not the PI3k/Akt pathway. Therefore, potentiated TRPM7 activity contributes to the devastating migratory and invasive characteristics of GBM.	NA	0
28061440	IL-6/STAT3/TWIST inhibition reverses ionizing radiation-induced EMT and radioresistance in esophageal squamous carcinoma.	The acquisition of radioresistance by esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESC) cells during radiotherapy may lead to cancer recurrence and poor survival. Previous studies have demonstrated that ionizing radiation (IR) induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of ESC cells accompanied by increased migration, invasion, and radioresistance. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of IR-induced EMT and radioresistance are not well established, hampering the development of potential solutions. To address this issue, we investigated the role of the IL-6/STAT3/TWIST signaling pathway in IR-induced EMT. We found not only the pathway was activated during IR-induced EMT but also STAT3 inhibition or Twist depletion reversed the EMT process and attenuated radioresistance. These results improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in IR-induced EMT and suggest potential interventions to prevent EMT-induced acquisition of radioresistance.	NA	0
28061439	Synthetic high-density lipoproteins as targeted monotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains incurable despite the introduction of new drugs. Therapies targeting receptors and pathways active specifically in malignant B cells might provide better treatment options. For instance, in B cell lymphoma, our group has previously shown that scavenger receptor type B-1 (SR-B1), the high-affinity receptor for cholesterol-rich high-density lipoproteins (HDL), is a therapeutic target. As evidence suggests that targeting cholesterol metabolism in CLL cells may have therapeutic benefit, we examined SR-B1 expression in primary CLL cells from patients. Unlike normal B cells that do not express SR-B1, CLL cells express the receptor. As a result, we evaluated cholesterol-poor synthetic HDL nanoparticles (HDL NP), known for targeting SR-B1, as a therapy for CLL. HDL NPs potently and selectively induce apoptotic cell death in primary CLL cells. HDL NPs had no effect on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals or patients with CLL. These data implicate SR-B1 as a target in CLL and HDL NPs as targeted monotherapy for CLL.	NA	2
28061438	Combination of Arsenic trioxide and Everolimus (Rad001) synergistically induces both autophagy and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.	The inhibitor of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, such as Rad001, has not shown therapeutic efficacy as a single agent in prostate cancer. Arsenic trioxide induces the autophagic pathway in prostate cancer cells. We identified Arsenic trioxide can synergize with Rad001 to induce cytotoxicity of prostate cancer cells. Moreover, we identified synergistic induction of autophagy and apoptosis as the underlying mechanism. This enhanced autophagic cell death is accompanied by increased Beclin1 mRNA stability as well as upregulation of ATG5-ATG12 conjugate, Beclin1, and LC3-2. Rad001 and ATO also can synergistically inhibit tumors in prostate cancer xenograft animal model. These results identify and validate a novel mechanism to enhance and expand the existing targeted therapeutic agent to treat prostate cancer.	NA	0
28061437	Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in kidney cancer: frequent methylation of KEAP1 gene promoter in clear renal cell carcinoma.	The Keap1/Nrf2 pathway is a master regulator of the cellular redox state through the induction of several antioxidant defence genes implicated in chemotherapeutic drugs resistance of tumor cells. An increasing body of evidence supports a key role for Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in kidney diseases and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but data concerning the molecular basis and the clinical effect of its deregulation remain incomplete.Here we present a molecular profiling of the KEAP1 and NFE2L2 genes in five different Renal Cell Carcinoma histotypes by analysing 89 tumor/normal paired tissues (clear cell Renal Carcinoma, ccRCCs; Oncocytomas; Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma Type 1, PRCC1; Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma Type 2, PRCC2; and Chromophobe Cell Carcinoma).A tumor-specific DNA methylation of the KEAP1 gene promoter region was found as a specific feature of the ccRCC subtype (18/37, 48.6%) and a direct correlation with mRNA levels was confirmed by in vitro 5-azacytidine treatment. Analysis of an independent data set of 481 ccRCC and 265 PRCC tumors corroborates our results and multivariate analysis reveals a significant correlation among ccRCCs epigenetic KEAP1 silencing and staging, grading and overall survival.Our molecular results show for the the first time the epigenetic silencing of KEAP1 promoter as the leading mechanism for modulation of KEAP1 expression in ccRCCs and corroborate the driver role of Keap1/Nrf2 axis deregulation with potential new function as independent epigenetic prognostic marker in renal cell carcinoma.	association	1
28061436	Multidrug resistance transporter profile reveals MDR3 as a marker for stratification of blastemal Wilms tumour patients.	Wilms tumour (WT) is the most common renal tumour in children. Most WT patients respond to chemotherapy, but subsets of tumours develop resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, which is a major obstacle in their successful treatment. Multidrug resistance transporters play a crucial role in the development of resistance in cancer due to the efflux of anticancer agents out of cells. The aim of this study was to explore several human multidrug resistance transporters in 46 WT and 40 non-neoplastic control tissues (normal kidney) from patients selected after chemotherapy treatment SIOP 93-01, SIOP 2001. Our data showed that the majority of the studied multidrug resistance transporters were downregulated or unchanged between tumours and control tissues. However, BCRP1, MDR3 and MRP1 were upregulated in tumours versus control tissues. MDR3 and MRP1 overexpression correlated with high-risk tumours (SIOP classification) (p = 0.0022 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively) and the time of disease-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with high transcript levels of MDR3 (p = 0.0359). MDR3 and MRP1 play a role in drug resistance in WT treatment, probably by alteration of an unspecific drug excretion system. Besides, within the blastemal subtype, we observed patients with low MDR3 expression were significantly associated with a better outcome than patients with high MDR3 expression. We could define two types of blastemal WT associated with different disease outcomes, enabling the stratification of blastemal WT patients based on the expression levels of the multidrug resistance transporter MDR3.

28061434	Systematic evaluation of supervised classifiers for fecal microbiota-based prediction of colorectal cancer.	Predicting colorectal cancer (CRC) based on fecal microbiota presents a promising method for non-invasive screening of CRC, but the optimization of classification models remains an unaddressed question. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of different supervised machine-learning models in predicting CRC in two independent eastern and western populations. The structures of intestinal microflora in feces in Chinese population (N = 141) were determined by 454 FLX pyrosequencing, and different supervised classifiers were employed to predict CRC based on fecal microbiota operational taxonomic unit (OTUs). As a result, Bayes Net and Random Forest displayed higher accuracies than other algorithms in both populations, although Bayes Net was found with a lower false negative rate than that of Random Forest. Gut microbiota-based prediction was more accurate than the standard fecal occult blood test (FOBT), and the combination of both approaches further improved the prediction accuracy. Moreover, when unclassified OTUs were used as input, the BayesDMNB text algorithm achieved higher accuracy in the Chinese population (AUC=0.994). Taken together, our results suggest that Bayes Net classification model combined with unclassified OTUs may present an accurate method for predicting CRC based on the compositions of gut microbiota.

28061433	Lovastatin upregulates microRNA-29b to reduce oxidative stress in rats with multiple cardiovascular risk factors.	AIMS: Proteasome-linked oxidative stress is believed to cause endothelial dysfunction, an early event in cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Statin, as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, prevents endothelial dysfunction in CVD. However, the molecular mechanism of statin-mediated normalization of endothelial function is not completely elucidated.METHODS AND RESULTS: Lovastatin time/dose-dependently increased miR-29b expression and decreased proteasome activity in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Anti-miR-29b or overexpression of PA200 abolished lovastatin-induced inhibition of proteasome activity in HUVECs. In contrast, pre-miR-29b or PA200 siRNA mimics these effects of lovastatin on proteasome activity. Lovastatin inhibited oxidative stress induced by multiple oxidants including ox-LDL, H2O2, TNFα, homocysteine thiolactone (HTL), and high glucose (HG), which were reversed by inhibition of miR-29b in HUVECs. Ex vivo analysis indicated that lovastatin normalized the acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation and the redox status in isolated rat aortic arteries exposure to multiple cardiovascular risk factors. In vivo analysis revealed that administration of lovastatin remarkably suppressed oxidative stress and prevented endothelial dysfunction in rats with hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hyperhomocysteinemia, as well as increased miR-29b expressions, reduced PA200 protein levels, and suppression of proteasome activity in aortic tissues.CONCLUSION: Upregulation of miR-29b expression is a common mechanism contributing to endothelial dysfunction induced by multiple cardiovascular risk factors through PA200-dependent proteasome-mediated oxidative stress, which is prevented by lovastatin.

28061432	Identification and functional analysis of a novel LHX1 mutation associated with congenital absence of the uterus and vagina.	Congenital absence of the uterus and vagina (CAUV) is the most extreme female Müllerian duct abnormality. Several researches proposed that genetic factors contributed to this disorder, whereas the precise genetic mechanism is far from full elucidation. Here, utilizing whole-exome sequencing (WES), we identified one novel missense mutation in LHX1 (NM_005568: c.G1108A, p.A370T) in one of ten unrelated patients diagnosed with CAUV. This mutation was absent from public databases and our internal database. Through the luciferase reporter analysis, we found that the mutation could change the transcriptional activity of LHX1 and its effect on the regulation of the downstream target gene GSC, which might be associated with urogenital system development. In short, we concluded that the LHX1 may be a pathogenic gene of CAUV. Our results demonstrate the power of whole exome sequencing and gene prioritization approach as diagnostic tools in clinical practice that help make genetic diagnosis of CAUV.	NA	0
28060766	Opposing roles of PIK3CA gene alterations to EZH2 signaling in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.	The high rates of tumor recurrence and progression represent a major clinical problem in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Previous data showed that EZH2-dependent signaling mediates these processes, whereas the frequent alterations of PIK3CA gene (copy gains and mutations) are predictive of reduced recurrence. Here we show, using clinical samples and bladder cancer cell lines, a functional interaction between EZH2- and PIK3CA-dependent signaling pathways. PIK3CA alterations mediated, on the one hand, the increased expression of two miRNAs, miR-101 and miR-138, which posttranscriptionally downregulate EZH2 expression. On the other hand, PIK3CA alterations facilitate the activation of Akt which phosphorylates EZH2 on Ser21, precluding the trimethylation of histone H3 in K27. Remarkably the increased expression of miR101 or miR138 and the expression of Ser21-phosphorylated EZH2 are good prognostic factors regarding non-muscle invasive bladder cancer recurrence and progression. Collectively, this study provides molecular evidences indicating that the gene expression rewiring occurring in primary bladder tumors, associated with increased EZH2 expression and activity and mediating the increased recurrence and progression risk, are prevented by PIK3CA-dependent signaling. This molecular process may have deep implications in the management of bladder cancer patients and in the design of novel molecularly targeted therapeutic approaches.	NA	2
28060765	Genetic polymorphisms in TERT are associated with increased risk of esophageal cancer.	Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TERT may be associated with susceptibility to esophageal cancer. In this study, we analyzed the association between TERT SNPs and risk of esophageal cancer in 386 esophageal cancer patients and 495 healthy subjects from the Xi'an area of China. Of the four SNPs examined, rs10069690 and rs2242652 were correlated with esophageal cancer risk. Additionally, after adjusting for age and gender, the &quot;Trs10069690Ars2242652&quot;, &quot;Trs10069690Grs2242652&quot; haplotypes were associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer, while the and &quot;Crs10069690Grs2242652&quot; haplotype was associated with a decreased risk of esophageal cancer. These findings suggest that TERT polymorphisms may contribute to the development of esophageal cancer.	NA	2
28060764	LOXL4 knockdown enhances tumor growth and lung metastasis through collagen-dependent extracellular matrix changes in triple-negative breast cancer.	Lysyl oxidase (LOX) family genes catalyze collagen cross-link formation. To determine the effects of lysyl oxidase-like 4 (LOXL4) expression on breast tumor formation and metastasis, we evaluated primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in mice injected with LOXL4-knockdown MDA-MB-231 triple-negative human breast cancer cells. In addition, we analyzed overall survival in breast cancer patients based on LOXL4 expression using a public online database. In the mouse xenograft model, LOXL4 knockdown increased primary tumor growth and lung colonization as well as collagen I and IV, lysine hydroxylase 1 and 2, and prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 1 and 2 levels. Second harmonic generation imaging revealed that LOXL4 knockdown resulted in the thickening of collagen bundles within tumors. In addition, weak LOXL4 expression was associated with poor overall survival in breast cancer patients from the BreastMark dataset, and this association was strongest in triple-negative breast cancer patients. These results demonstrate that weak LOXL4 expression leads to remodeling of the extracellular matrix through induction of collagen synthesis, deposition, and structural changes. These alterations in turn promote tumor growth and metastasis and are associated with poor clinical outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer.	prognostic	1
28060763	Comparison of the tumor cell secretome and patient sera for an accurate serum-based diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.	Pancreatic cancer is the currently most lethal malignancy. Toward an accurate diagnosis of the disease in body liquids, we studied the protein composition of the secretomes of 16 primary and established cell lines of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Compared to the secretome of non-tumorous cells, 112 proteins exhibited significantly different abundances. Functionally, the proteins were associated with PDAC features, such as decreased apoptosis, better cell survival and immune cell regulation. The result was compared to profiles obtained from 164 serum samples from two independent cohorts - a training and a test set - of patients with PDAC or chronic pancreatitis and healthy donors. Eight of the 112 secretome proteins exhibited similar variations in their abundance in the serum profile specific for PDAC patients, which was composed of altogether 189 proteins. The 8 markers shared by secretome and serum yielded a 95.1% accuracy of distinguishing PDAC from healthy in a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis, while any number of serum-only markers produced substantially less accurate results. Utility of the identified markers was confirmed by classical enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The study highlights the value of cell secretome analysis as a means of defining reliable serum biomarkers.	NA	0
28060762	Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 is a prognostic marker and its kinase a potential therapeutic target in HCC.	Hepatocellular carcinoma is a cancer with increasing incidence and largely refractory to current anticancer drugs. Since Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor has shown modest efficacy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma additional treatments are highly needed. Protein phosphorylation via kinases is an important post-translational modification to regulate cell homeostasis including proliferation and apoptosis. Therefore kinases are valuable targets in cancer therapy. To this end we performed 2D differential gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analysis of phosphoprotein-enriched lysates of tumor and corresponding non-tumorous liver samples to detect differentially abundant phosphoproteins to screen for novel kinases as potential drug targets. We identified 34 differentially abundant proteins in phosphoprotein enriched lysates. Expression and distribution of the candidate protein eEF2 and its phosphorylated isoform was validated immunohistochemically on 78 hepatocellular carcinoma and non-tumorous tissue samples. Validation showed that total eEF2 and phosphorylated eEF2 at threonine 56 are prognostic markers for overall survival of HCC-patients. The activity of the regulating eEF2 kinase, compared between tumor and non-tumorous tissue lysates by in vitro kinase assays, is more than four times higher in tumor tissues. Functional analyzes regarding eEF2 kinase were performed in JHH5 cells with CRISPR/Cas9 mediated eEF2 kinase knock out. Proliferation and growth is decreased in eEF2 kinase knock out cells.CONCLUSION: eEF2 and phosphorylated eEF2 are prognostic markers for survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients and the regulating eEF2 kinase is a potential drug target for tumor therapy.

28060761	Identification of microRNAs associated with glioma diagnosis and prognosis.	The sensitivity and specificity of microRNAs (miRNAs) for diagnosing glioma are controversial. We therefore performed a meta-analysis to systematically identify glioma-associated miRNAs. We initially screened five miRNA microarray datasets to evaluate the differential expression of miRNAs between glioma and normal tissues. We next compared the expression of the miRNAs in different organs and tissues to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the differentially expressed miRNAs in the diagnosis of glioma. Finally, pathway analysis was performed using GeneGO. We identified 27 candidate miRNAs associated with glioma initiation, progression, and patient prognosis. Sensitivity and specificity analysis indicated miR-15a, miR-16, miR-21, miR-23a, and miR-9 were up-regulated, while miR-124 was down-regulated in glioma. Ten signaling pathways showed the strongest association with glioma development and progression: the p53 pathway feedback loops 2, Interleukin signaling pathway, Toll receptor signaling pathway, Parkinson's disease, Notch signaling pathway, Cadherin signaling pathway, Apoptosis signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, Alzheimer disease-amyloid secretase pathway, and the FGF signaling pathway. Our results indicate that the integration of miRNA, gene, and protein expression data can yield valuable biomarkers for glioma diagnosis and treatment. Indeed, six of the miRNAs identified in this study may be useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in glioma.	NA	2
28060760	PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor BEZ235 and histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A synergistically exert anti-tumor activity in breast cancer.	Molecule-targeted therapy has achieved great progress in cancer therapy. Effective drug combinations are one way to enhance the therapeutic efficacy and combat resistance. Here, we determined the effect of the PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor BEZ235 and the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) on human breast cancer. We demonstrated that the combination of BEZ235 and TSA results in significant synergistic growth inhibition of multiple breast cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies revealed that the combined therapy induced apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner, which might be related to the further depression of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway. Additionally, co-treatment with BEZ235 and TSA enhanced autophagic cell death by up-regulating the expression of LC3B-II and Beclin-1. The vivo tumour modelling studies revealed that BEZ235 combined with TSA blocked tumour growth without noticeable side effects. These data suggest that the combination of BEZ235 and TSA may be a new selective strategy, which may have significant clinical application in the treatment of breast cancer patients.	NA	0
28060759	A potential prognostic lncRNA signature for predicting survival in patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma.	Increasing evidence has highlighted the critical roles of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in cancer development and progression. However, the prognostic power of expression-based lncRNA signature for predicting overall survival in patients with Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma (BLCA) has not been investigated. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis for lncRNA expression profiles and corresponding clinical information of 234 BLCA patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We established a set of four-lncRNAs that were significantly associated with BLCA patients' survival. Using the prognostic four-lncRNA signature, we successfully classified the BLCA patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, and the prognostic power of the four-lncRNA signature was further validated in the testing dataset and entire dataset. Multivariate Cox regression and stratified analyses demonstrated that the prognostic power of the four-lncRNA signature was independent of other clinical variables. Functional enrichment analyses suggested the four prognostic lncRNAs may be involved in known BLCA-related biological processes and pathways. Our results demonstrated that the four-lncRNA signature could be novel independent biomarkers for predicting survival in patients with BLCA.	NA	2
28060758	Exosomes as mediators of platinum resistance in ovarian cancer.	Exosomes have been implicated in the cell-cell transfer of oncogenic proteins and genetic material. We speculated this may be one mechanism by which an intrinsically platinum-resistant population of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells imparts its influence on surrounding tumor cells. To explore this possibility we utilized a platinum-sensitive cell line, A2780 and exosomes derived from its resistant subclones, and an unselected, platinum-resistant EOC line, OVCAR10. A2780 cells demonstrate a ~2-fold increase in viability upon treatment with carboplatin when pre-exposed to exosomes from platinum-resistant cells as compared to controls. This coincided with increased epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). DNA sequencing of EOC cell lines revealed previously unreported somatic mutations in the Mothers Against Decapentaplegic Homolog 4 (SMAD4) within platinum-resistant cells. A2780 cells engineered to exogenously express these SMAD4 mutations demonstrate up-regulation of EMT markers following carboplatin treatment, are more resistant to carboplatin, and release exosomes which impart a ~1.7-fold increase in resistance in naive A2780 recipient cells as compared to controls. These studies provide the first evidence that acquired SMAD4 mutations enhance the chemo-resistance profile of EOC and present a novel mechanism in which exchange of tumor-derived exosomes perpetuates an EMT phenotype, leading to the development of subpopulations of platinum-refractory cells.

28060757	LINE-1 hypomethylation status of circulating cell-free DNA in plasma as a biomarker for colorectal cancer.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a serious public health problem and non-invasive biomarkers improving diagnosis or therapy are strongly required. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been a promising target for this purpose. In this study, we evaluated the potential of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) hypomethylation as a blood biomarker for CRC. LINE-1 hypomethylation level in plasma cfDNA in 114 CRC patients was retrospectively examined by absolute quantitative analysis of methylated alleles real-time PCR, and was expressed using LINE-1 hypomethylation index (LHI) [unmethylated copy number/ (methylated copy number + unmethylated copy number)]. Greater LHI values indicated enhanced hypomethylation. In our clinicopathological analysis, CRC patients with large tumors (≥6.0 cm), advanced N stage (≥2), and distant metastasis (M1) had statistically significantly higher cfDNA LHI than other CRC patients, suggesting cfDNA LHI as a disease progression biomarker for CRC. Furthermore, early stage I/II (n = 57) as well as advanced stage III/IV (n =57) CRC patients had significantly higher cfDNA LHI than healthy donors (n=53) [stage I/II: median 0.369 (95% confidence interval, 0.360-0.380) vs. 0.332 (0.325-0.339), P &lt; 0.0001; stage III/IV: 0.372 (0.365-0.388) vs. 0.332 (0.325-0.339), P &lt; 0.0001]. The receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that cfDNA LHI had the detection capacity of CRC with area under the curve(AUC) of 0.79 and 0.83 in stage I/II and stage III/IV CRC patients, respectively. The present study demonstrated for the first time the potential of plasma cfDNA LHI as a novel biomarker for CRC, particularly for early stage detection.	NA	2
28060756	Baicalein has protective effects on the 17β-estradiol-induced transformation of breast epithelial cells.	Epidemiologic and systematic studies have indicated that flavonoid consumption is associated with a lower incidence of breast cancer. Baicalein is the primary flavonoid derived from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. In the current study, the long-term exposure of breast epithelial cells to 17β-estradiol (E2) was used to investigate the chemopreventive potential of baicalein on neoplastic transformation. The results demonstrated that baicalein significantly inhibited E2-induced cell growth, motility, and invasiveness, and suppressed E2-induced misshapen acini formation in 3D cultures. Furthermore, it inhibited the ability of E2-induced cells to form clones in agarose and tumors in NOD/SCID immunodeficient mice. Docking studies using Sybyl-X 1.2 software showed that baicalein could bind to both estrogen receptor-α (ERa) and G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 30 (GPR30), which are two critical E2-mediated pathways. Baicalein prevented the E2-induced ERa-mediated activation of nuclear transcriptional signaling by interfering with the trafficking of ERa into the nucleus and subsequent binding to estrogen response elements, thereby decreasing the mRNA levels of ERa target genes. It also inhibited E2-induced GPR30-mediated signal transduction, as well as the transcription of GPR30-regulated genes. Therefore, these results suggest that baicalein is a potential drug for reducing the risk of estrogen-dependent breast cancer.	NA	0
28060755	Antitumor and antimetastatic activities of a novel benzothiazole-2-thiol derivative in a murine model of breast cancer.	The prognosis of metastatic breast cancer is always very poor. Thus, it is urgent to develop novel drugs with less toxicity against metastatic breast cancer. A new drug (XC-591) derived from benzothiazole-2-thiol was designed and synthesized in our lab. In this study, we tried to assess effects of XC-591 treatment on primary breast cancer and pulmonary metastasis in 4T1 mice model. Furthermore, we tried to discover its possible molecular mechanism of action. MTT experiment showed XC-591 had significant anti-cancer activity on diverse cancer cells. Furthermore, XC-591 significantly suppressed the proliferation of 4T1 cells by colony formation assay. The in vivo results displayed that XC-591 could inhibit the growth and metastasis in 4T1 model. Moreover, histological analysis revealed that XC-591 treatment increased apoptosis, inhibited proliferation and angiogenesis in vivo. In addition, XC-591 did not contribute to obvious drug associated toxicity during the whole study. Molecular mechanism showed XC-591 could inhibit RhoGDI, activate caspase-3 and decrease phosphorylated Akt. The present data may be important to further explore this kind of new small-molecule inhibitor.	NA	0
28060754	Diagnostic value of FIB-4 for liver fibrosis in patients with hepatitis B: a meta-analysis of diagnostic test.	This study is aimed at evaluating the diagnostic value of FIB-4 for liver fibrosis in patients with hepatitis B through a meta-analysis of diagnostic test. We conducted a comprehensive search in the Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure before October 31, 2016. Stata 14.0 software was used for calculation and statistical analyses. We used the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio (PLR, NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the diagnostic value of FIB-4 for liver fibrosis in patients with hepatitis B. Twenty-six studies were included in the final analyses, with a total of 8274 individuals. The pooled parameters are calculated from all studies: sensitivity of 0.69 (95%CI:0.63-0.75), specificity of 0.81 (95%CI: 0.73-0.87), PLR of 3.63 (95%CI:2.66-4.94), NLR of 0.38 (95%CI:0.32-0.44), DOR of 9.57 (95%CI: 6.67-13.74), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 (95%CI: 0.76-0.83). We also conducted subgroup based on the range of cut-off values. Results from subgroup analysis showed that cut-off was the source of heterogeneity in the present study. The sensitivity and specificity of cut-off&gt;2 were 0.69 and 0.95 with the AUC of 0.90 (95%CI: 0.87-0.92). The overall diagnostic value of FIB-4 is not very high for liver fibrosis in patients with hepatitis B. However, the diagnostic value is affected by the cut-off value. FIB-4 has relatively high diagnostic value for detecting liver fibrosis in patients with hepatitis B when the diagnostic threshold value is more than 2.0.	NA	0
28060753	Clostridium difficile colonization in preoperative colorectal cancer patients.	The entire process of Clostridium difficile colonization to infection develops in large intestine. However, the real colonization pattern of C. difficile in preoperative colorectal cancer patients has not been studied. In this study, 33 C. difficile strains (16.1%) were isolated from stool samples of 205 preoperative colorectal cancer patients. C. difficile colonization rates in lymph node metastasis patients (22.3%) were significantly higher than lymph node negative patients (10.8%) (OR=2.314, 95%CI=1.023-5.235, P =0.025). Meanwhile, patients positive for stool occult blood had lower C. difficile colonization rates than negative patients (11.5% vs. 24.0%, OR=0.300, 95%CI=0.131-0.685, P =0.019). A total of 16 sequence types were revealed by multilocus sequence typing. Minimum spanning tree and time-space cluster analysis indicated that all C. difficile isolates were epidemiologically unrelated. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and metronidazole. The results suggested that the prevalence of C. difficile colonization is high in preoperative colorectal cancer patients, and the colonization is not acquired in the hospital. Since lymph node metastasis colorectal cancer patients inevitably require adjuvant chemotherapy and C. difficile infection may halt the ongoing treatment, the call for sustained monitoring of C. difficile in those patients is apparently urgent.

28060752	Elevated spondin-2 expression correlates with progression and prognosis in gastric cancer.	The spondin-2 correlated with tumor progression in many malignancies. However, the role of spondin-2 in gastric cancer has not been thoroughly elucidated. Spondin-2 and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 174 gastric carcinoma tissues. The relationship between the expression of spondin-2 and MMP-9, clinicopathological/prognostic value in gastric cancer was examined. Spondin-2 was significantly higher in gastric cancer than that in adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Spondin-2 overexpression was significantly associated with well differentiation, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stages. The expression levels of spondin-2 were increasing in both prominent serosal invasion group and lymph node metastasis group. In addition, spondin-2 was positively correlated with MMP-9 among 174 gastric cancer samples. In univariate and multivariate analyses, spondin-2 was an independent prognostic factor for both recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Moreover, spondin-2 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer in different risk groups. In conclusion, Spondin-2 overexpression contributes to tumor aggressiveness and prognosis, and could be a promising target for prognostic prediction in gastric cancer patients.	prognostic	1
28060751	The small heat shock protein B8 (HSPB8) modulates proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells.	Breast cancer (BC) is one of the major causes of cancer death in women and is closely related to hormonal dysregulation. Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive BCs are generally treated with anti hormone therapy using antiestrogens or aromatase inhibitors. However, BC cells may become resistant to endocrine therapy, a process facilitated by autophagy, which may either promote or suppress tumor expansion. The autophagy facilitator HSPB8 has been found overexpressed in some BC. Here we found that HSPB8 is highly expressed and differentially modulated by natural or synthetic selective ER modulators (SERMs), in the triple-positive hormone-sensitive BC (MCF-7) cells, but not in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 BC cells. Specific SERMs induced MCF-7 cells proliferation in a HSPB8 dependent manner whereas, did not modify MDA-MB-231 cell growth. ER expression was unaffected in HSPB8-depleted MCF-7 cells. HSPB8 over-expression did not alter the distribution of MCF-7 cells in the various phases of the cell cycle. Conversely and intriguingly, HSPB8 downregulation resulted in an increased number of cells resting in the G0/G1 phase, thus possibly reducing the ability of the cells to pass through the restriction point. In addition, HSPB8 downregulation reduced the migratory ability of MCF-7 cells. None of these modifications were observed, when another small HSP (HSPB1), also expressed in MCF-7 cells, was downregulated. In conclusion, our data suggest that HSPB8 is involved in the mechanisms that regulate cell cycle and cell migration in MCF-7 cells.	NA	0
28060750	HIPK2-T566 autophosphorylation diversely contributes to UV- and doxorubicin-induced HIPK2 activation.	HIPK2 is a Y-regulated S/T kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell-fate decision during development and DNA damage response. Cis-autophosphorylation in the activation-loop and trans-autophosphorylation at several S/T sites along the protein are required for HIPK2 activation, subcellular localization, and subsequent posttranslational modifications. The specific function of a few of these autophosphorylations has been recently clarified; however, most of the sites found phosphorylated by mass spectrometry in human and/or mouse HIPK2 are still uncharacterized. In the process of studying HIPK2 in human colorectal cancers, we identified a mutation (T566P) in a site we previously found autophosphorylated in mouse Hipk2. Biochemical and functional characterization of this site showed that compared to wild type (wt) HIPK2, HIPK2-T566P maintains nuclear-speckle localization and has only a mild reduction in kinase and growth arresting activities upon overexpression. Next, we assessed cell response following UV-irradiation or treatment with doxorubicin, two well-known HIPK2 activators, by evaluating cell number and viability, p53-Ser46 phosphorylation, p21 induction, and caspase cleavage. Interestingly, cells expressing HIPK2-T566P mutant did not respond to UV-irradiation, while behaved similarly to wt HIPK2 upon doxorubicin-treatment. Evaluation of HIPK2-T566 phosphorylation status by a T566-phospho-specific antibody showed constitutive phosphorylation in unstressed cells, which was maintained after doxorubicin-treatment but inhibited by UV-irradiation. Taken together, these data show that HIPK2-T566 phosphorylation contributes to UV-induced HIPK2 activity but it is dispensable for doxorubicin response.	NA	2
28060749	NIDO, AMOP and vWD domains of MUC4 play synergic role in MUC4 mediated signaling.	MUC4 mucin is well known as an important potential target to overcome pancreatic cancer. Three unique domains (NIDO, AMOP, and vWD) with unclear roles only present in MUC4 but are not found in other membrane-bound mucins. Our previous studies first reported that its splice variant, MUC4/Y can be a model of MUC4 (MUC4 gene fragment is more than 30KB, too huge to clone and eukaryotic express) in pancreatic cancer. More importantly, based on MUC4/Y with the appropriate length of gene sequence, it is easy to construct the unique domain-lacking models of MUC4/Y (MUC4) for research. The present study focuses on investigation of the respective role of the unique NIDO, AMOP, and vWD domain or their synergistic effect on MUC4(MUC4/Y)-mediated functions and mechanisms by series of in vitro assays, sequence-based transcriptome analysis, validation of qRT-PCR &amp; Western blot, and systematic comparative analysis. Our results demonstrate: 1) NIDO, AMOP, and vWD domain or their synergy play significant roles on MUC4/Y-mediated malignant function of pancreatic cancer, downstream of molecule mechanisms, particularly MUC4/Y-triggered malignancy-related positive feedback loops, respectively. 2) The synergistic roles of three unique domains on MUC4/Y-mediated functions and mechanisms are more prominent than the respective domain because the synergy of three domain plays the more remarkable effects on MUC4/Y-mediated signaling hub. Thus, to improve reversed effects of domain-lacking and break the synergism of domains will contribute to block MUC4/Y(MUC4) triggering various oncogenic signaling pathways.	NA	0
28060748	Is the pathological regression level of metastatic lymph nodes associated with oncologic outcomes following preoperative chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer?	PURPOSE: The oncologic impact of the lymph node (LN) regression level after preoperative chemoradiotherapy (PCRT) has not been thoroughly evaluated. Hence, this study aimed to examine whether the regression level of metastatic LNs following PCRT is associated with oncologic outcomes in rectal cancer.RESULTS: The optimal number of cut points for LRG sum was determined to be three. The three LRG groups demonstrated different distributions according to the ypT and ypN stages (p &lt; 0.001 for both). However, the distribution of the LRG groups was not associated with the TRG of the primary tumor (p = 0.527). The RFS significantly differed according to the LRG groups (p = 0.001). Moreover, the differences in RFS remained when the LRG groups were analyzed within each separate ypN stage. The LRG group was confirmed as a factor associated with RFS in the multivariate analysis (p=0.018), while the ypN stage was not (p=0.4).PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the outcomes of 142 rectal cancer patients diagnosed with ypN1 disease after PCRT followed by radical resection. The pathological responses of the primary tumor and LNs to PCRT were evaluated using the tumor regression grade (TRG) and LN regression grade (LRG), respectively. The impact of LRG on recurrence-free survival (RFS) was analyzed. The K-adaptive partitioning for survival data method was applied to determine the optimal number of cut points for the LRG-sum and the optimal number of subgroups.CONCLUSION: The LRG as an indicator of response to PCRT should be considered as a prognostic determinant in rectal cancer patients. Future large-scale prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding.	NA	0
28060747	25-Hydroxycholesterol is involved in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	This study aimed to evaluate the levels of three major hydroxycholesterols (24-, 25-, and 27-hydroxycholesterols) in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as to show their role in the pathogenesis of ALS experimental models. The level of 25-hydroxycholesterol were higher in untreated ALS patients (n = 30) than in controls without ALS (n = 33) and ALS patients treated with riluzole (n = 9) both in their serum and CSF. The level of 25-hydroxycholesterol in the serum of ALS patients were significantly associated with their disease severity and rate of progression. In the motor neuron-like cell line (NSC34) with the human mutant G93A superoxide dismutase 1 gene (mSOD1-G93A), 25-hydroxycholesterol induced motor neuronal death/ apoptosis via glycogen synthase kinase-3β and liver X receptor pathways; riluzole treatment attenuated these effects. The expressions of enzymes that synthesize 25-hydroxycholesterol were significantly increased in the brains of early symptomatic mSOD1G93A mice. Our data, obtained from patients with ALS, a cellular model of ALS, and an animal model of ALS, suggests that 25-hydroxycholesterol could be actively involved in the pathogenesis of ALS, mostly in the early symptomatic disease stage, by mediating neuronal apoptosis.

28060746	Mitochondrial deficiency impairs hypoxic induction of HIF-1 transcriptional activity and retards tumor growth.	Mitochondria can be involved in regulating cellular stress response to hypoxia and tumor growth, but little is known about that mechanistic relationship. Here, we show that mitochondrial deficiency severely retards tumor xenograft growth with impairing hypoxic induction of HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Using mtDNA-deficient ρ0 cells, we found that HIF-1 pathway activation was comparable in slow-growing ρ0 xenografts and rapid-growing parental xenografts. Interestingly, we found that ex vivo ρ0 cells derived from ρ0 xenografts exhibited slightly increased HIF-1α expression and modest HIF-1 pathway activation regardless of oxygen concentration. Surprisingly, ρ0 cells, as well as parental cells treated with oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors, were unable to boost HIF-1 transcriptional activity during hypoxia, although HIF-1α protein levels were ordinarily increased in these cells under hypoxic conditions. These findings indicate that mitochondrial deficiency causes loss of hypoxia-induced HIF-1 transcriptional activity and thereby might lead to a constitutive HIF-1 pathway activation as a cellular adaptation mechanism in tumor microenvironment.

28060745	Expression of Notch1 and Numb in small cell lung cancer.	Notch signaling in tumorigenesis functions as an oncogene or tumor suppressor according to the type of malignancy. Numb represses intracellular Notch signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that Notch signaling suppresses the proliferation of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines. However, in SCLC, the association between Notch1 and Numb expression and clinicopathological factors or prognosis has remained unclear. In this study, we evaluated the expression of Notch1 and Numb in SCLC. We immunohistochemically assessed 125 SCLCs that were surgically resected at 16 institutions participating in either the Hokkaido Lung Cancer Clinical Study Group Trial (HOT) or the Fukushima Investigative Group for Healing Thoracic Malignancy (FIGHT) between 2003 and 2013. Correlations between Notch1 or Numb expression and various clinicopathological features were evaluated. Notch1 expression was associated with ECOG performance status. Numb expression was associated with age, sex, and pathological histology (SCLC or Combined SCLC). Analysis of cellular biological expression did not demonstrate a significant correlation between the expression of Notch1 and of Numb. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that high Notch1 expression was an independent favorable prognostic factor for SCLC(hazard ratio = 0.503, P = 0.023). High Notch1 expression, but not Numb expression, is associated with favorable prognosis in SCLC.	prognostic	1
28060744	Targeting macrophage anti-tumor activity to suppress melanoma progression.	By phagocytosing cancer cells and their cellular debris, macrophages play a critical role in nonspecific defense (innate immunity) and, as antigen presenters, they help initiate specific defense mechanisms (adaptive immunity). Malignant melanoma is a lethal disease due to its aggressive capacity for metastasis and resistance to therapy. For decades, considerable effort has gone into development of an effective immunotherapy for treatment of metastatic melanoma. In this review, we focus on the anti-tumor activities of macrophages in melanoma and their potential as therapeutic targets in melanoma. Although macrophages can be re-educated through intercellular signaling to promote tumor survival owing to their plasticity, we expect that targeting the anti-tumor activity of macrophages remains a promising strategy for melanoma inhibition. The combination of tumoricidal macrophage activation and other treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, may provide an effective and comprehensive anti-melanoma strategy.	NA	0
28060743	2017 update on the relationship between diabetes and colorectal cancer: epidemiology, potential molecular mechanisms and therapeutic implications.	Worldwide deaths from diabetes mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer increased by 90% and 57%, respectively, over the past 20 years. The risk of colorectal cancer was estimated to be 27% higher in patients with type 2 DM than in non-diabetic controls. However, there are potential confounders, information from lower income countries is scarce, across the globe there is no correlation between DM prevalence and colorectal cancer incidence and the association has evolved over time, suggesting the impact of additional environmental factors. The clinical relevance of these associations depends on understanding the mechanism involved. Although evidence is limited, insulin use has been associated with increased and metformin with decreased incidence of colorectal cancer. In addition, colorectal cancer shares some cellular and molecular pathways with diabetes target organ damage, exemplified by diabetic kidney disease. These include epithelial cell injury, activation of inflammation and Wnt/β-catenin pathways and iron homeostasis defects, among others. Indeed, some drugs have undergone clinical trials for both cancer and diabetic kidney disease. Genome-wide association studies have identified diabetes-associated genes (e.g. TCF7L2) that may also contribute to colorectal cancer. We review the epidemiological evidence, potential pathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic implications of the association between DM and colorectal cancer. Further studies should clarify the worldwide association between DM and colorectal cancer, strengthen the biological plausibility of a cause-and-effect relationship through characterization of the molecular pathways involved, search for specific molecular signatures of colorectal cancer under diabetic conditions, and eventually explore DM-specific strategies to prevent or treat colorectal cancer.

28060742	Overexpression of lncRNA ANRIL up-regulates VEGF expression and promotes angiogenesis of diabetes mellitus combined with cerebral infarction by activating NF-κB signaling pathway in a rat model.	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the effects of lncRNA ANRIL on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiogenesis in diabetes mellitus (DM) combined with cerebral infarction (CI) through NF-κB signaling pathway.METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control group and DM + CI group, and the DM + CI group were subdivided into Vector, shANRIL, PDTC, pcDNA-ANRIL, and pcDNA-ANRIL + PDTC groups. VEGF and FMS-like tyrosine kinase (FLT-1) expressions were measured by immunohistochemistry and endothelium dependent microvessel density (MVD) was detected by differentiation 31 (CD31) and para-amiuosalicylic acid (PAS) double staining. The qRT-PCR was applied to measure mRNA expressions of VEGF, FLT-1, Kinase insert domain protein receptor (FLK-1) and NF-κB, and Western blotting was conducted to detected expressions of VEGF, NF-κB and p-IκB/IκB.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, protein expressions of VEGF, NF-κB, p-IκB/IκB, expression of ANRIL, and mRNA expressions of VEGF, FLT-1 and NF-κB were increased in the DM + CI group. Compared with the Vector group, protein expressions of VEGF, NF-κB, p-IκB/IκB, expression of ANRIL, mRNA expressions of VEGF, FLT-1 and NF-κB, and endothelium dependent MVD were increased in the pcDNA-ANRIL group, while decreased in the shANRIL group and PDTC group. Compared with the pcDNA-ANRIL group, protein expressions of VEGF, NF-κB, p-IκB/IκB, expression of ANRIL, mRNA expressions of VEGF, FLT-1 and NF-κB, and endothelium dependent MVD were decreased in the pcDNA-ANRIL + PDTC group.CONCLUSION: Overexpressed lncRNA ANRIL upregulates VEGF and promotes angiogenesis by activating NF-κB signaling pathway in DM + CI rats. .

28060741	Cigarette smoke induced urocystic epithelial mesenchymal transition via MAPK pathways.	Cigarette smoke has been shown to be a major risk factor for bladder cancer. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial process in cancer development. The role of MAPK pathways in regulating cigarette smoke-triggered urocystic EMT remains to be elucidated. Human normal urothelial cells and BALB/c mice were used as in vitro and in vivo cigarette smoke exposure models. Exposure of human normal urothelial cells to cigarette smoke induced morphological change, enhanced migratory and invasive capacities, reduced epithelial marker expression and increased mesenchymal marker expression, along with the activation of MAPK pathways. Moreover, we revealed that ERK1/2 and p38 inhibitors, but rather JNK inhibitor, effectively attenuated cigarette smoke-induced urocystic EMT. Importantly, the regulatory function of ERK1/2 and p38 pathways in cigarette smoke-triggered urocystic EMT was further confirmed in mice exposed to CS for 12 weeks. These findings could provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of cigarette smoke-associated bladder cancer development as well as its potential intervention.	NA	0
28060740	Targeted activation of AMPK by GSK621 ameliorates H2O2-induced damages in osteoblasts.	GSK621 is a novel AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator. This study tested its potential cytoprotective effect in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-treated osteoblasts. In cultured MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells and primary murine osteoblasts, GSK621 significantly attenuated H2O2-induced cell death and apoptosis. AMPK activation was required for GSK621-induced osteoblast cytoprotection. Inhibition of AMPK, by AMPKα1 T172A mutation or shRNA silence, almost completely blocked GSK621-induced osteoblast cytoprotection. Reversely, introduction of a constitutively-active AMPKα1 (T172D) alleviated H2O2 injuries in MC3T3-E1 cells. Further, GSK621 increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) content in osteoblasts to inhibit H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Meanwhile, GSK621 activated cytoprotective autophagy in the osteoblasts. On the other hand, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy alleviated GSK621-mediated osteoblast cytoprotection against H2O2. These results suggest that targeted activation of AMPK by GSK621 ameliorates H2O2-induced osteoblast cell injuries.	NA	0
28060739	A novel microRNAs expression signature for hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis and prognosis.	This study aims to identify prognostic microRNAs (miRNAs) biomarkers for diagnosis and survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on large patients cohort analysis. HCC patient cohort data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas, including paired HCC and adjacent non-cancer tissues. Receiver operating characteristic curve method was used to classify cancer and non-cancer tissues according to microRNAs expression levels. The aberrant microRNAs expression level were ranked and risked for building a prognostic miRNAs signature model. Kaplan-Meier survival was used to analyze the differences among various risk factors in accordance with miRNAs ranking scores. The study showed 33-miRNA signature, 11 were down-regulated and 22 were up-regulated through comparison between cancer samples and non-cancer samples. The maximum correct classification rate is up to 98.7%. Five microRNAs, hsa-mir-3677, hsa-mir-421, hsa-mir-326, hsa-mir-424 and hsa-mir-511-2, significantly correlated with patient survival. The survival rate and time negatively associated with lowering miRNAs index. In the low risk group, over 70% patients showed 5 years survival, while none patients survived longer than 5 years in the high risk group. MiR-424, miR-326 and miR-511 could be applied for HCC diagnostic biomarkers. These five miRNAs were significantly associated with lysosome pathway and D-Glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism pathway via Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis and Gene Ontology annotation. Conclusively, the five miRNAs expression signature could be used as HCC prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers.	NA	2
28060738	The prognostic value of clonal heterogeneity and quantitative assessment of plasma circulating clonal IG-VDJ sequences at diagnosis in patients with follicular lymphoma.	Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have enabled the quantitation of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) encoding the clonal rearranged V(D)J immunoglobulin locus. We aimed to evaluate the clonal heterogeneity of follicular lymphoma (FL) in the tumour and the plasma at diagnosis and to assess the prognostic value of the ctDNA level. Plasma samples at diagnosis were available for 34 patients registered in the PRIMA trial (NCT00140582). One tumour clonotype or more could be detected for 29 (85%) and 25 (74%) patients, respectively, in the tumour or plasma samples. In 18 patients, several subclones were detected in the tumour (2 to 71 subclones/cases) and/or in the plasma (2 to 20 subclones/cases). In more than half of the cases, the distribution of subclones differed between the tumour and plasma samples, reflecting high clonal heterogeneity and diversity in lymphoma subclone dissemination. In multivariate analysis, a high level of ctDNA was the only independent factor associated with patients' progression-free survival (HR 4, IC 95 (1.1-37), p=.039). In conclusion, an NGS-based immunosequencing method reveals the marked clonal heterogeneity of follicular lymphoma in patients with FL, and quantification of ctDNA at diagnosis represents a potential powerful prognostic biomarker that needs to be investigated in larger cohorts.

28060737	Elevated UHRF1 expression contributes to poor prognosis by promoting cell proliferation and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma.	Ubiquitin-like with plant homeodomain and ring finger domains, 1 (UHRF1) is overexpressed in a variety of tumor tissues and is negatively correlated with prognosis of patients with cancers, yet so far, a comprehensive study of UHRF1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been conducted. The present study was designed to explore the expression of UHRF1, associated clinical implications, and its possible functions in HCC. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect UHRF1 expression in HCC specimens including cancerous and noncancerous tissues. Associations of UHRF1 expression with demographic and clinicopathologic features in HCC were analyzed, and the effects of RNA interference of UHRF1 on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration were investigated in vitro and in vivo. UHRF1 mRNA and protein expression were both upregulated and negatively correlated with prognosis in HCC patients. Furthermore, inhibition of proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition progression were observed in vitro and in vivo after UHRF1 knockdown, moreover, G2/M arrest was detected in HCC cells. In conclusion, elevated UHRF1 expression contributes to poor prognosis by promoting cell proliferation and metastasis in HCC.	prognostic	1
28060736	Investigating the utility of human melanoma cell lines as tumour models.	Melanoma researchers utilize cell lines to model many tumour phenomena. It is thus important to understand similarities and differences between cell lines and the tumours that they represent, so that the optimal models can be chosen to answer specific research questions. Herein, we compared the transcriptomes of 42 melanoma cell lines to hundreds of tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas and thousands of single melanoma cells. Tumour purity was accounted for using the ESTIMATE algorithm, so that differences likely resulting from non-tumour cells could be accounted for. In addition, UV mutational signatures and the expression of skin-associated genes were analyzed in order to identify the putative origin of various cell lines. We found the transcriptional and mutational characteristics of melanoma cell lines to mirror those of the tumours, with the exception of immune-associated transcripts, which were absent in cell culture. We also determined cell lines that highly or poorly recapitulate melanomas and have identified colon (COLO 741) and lung (COLO 699) cancer cell lines that may actually be melanoma. In summary, this study represents a comprehensive comparison of melanoma cell lines and tumours that can be used as a guide for researchers when selecting melanoma cell line models.	NA	0
28060735	The natural compound fucoidan from New Zealand Undaria pinnatifida synergizes with the ERBB inhibitor lapatinib enhancing melanoma growth inhibition.	Melanoma remains one of the most aggressive and therapy-resistant cancers. Finding new treatments to improve patient outcomes is an ongoing effort. We previously demonstrated that melanoma relies on the activation of ERBB signaling, specifically of the ERBB3/ERBB2 cascade. Here we show that melanoma tumor growth is inhibited by 60% over controls when treated with lapatinib, a clinically approved inhibitor of ERBB2/EGFR. Importantly, tumor growth is further inhibited to 85% when the natural compound fucoidan from New Zealand U. pinnatifida is integrated into the treatment regimen. Fucoidan not only enhances tumor growth inhibition, it counteracts the morbidity associated with prolonged lapatinib treatment. Fucoidan doubles the cell killing capacity of lapatinib. These effects are associated with a further decrease in AKT and NFκB signaling, two key pathways involved in melanoma cell survival. Importantly, the enhancing cell killing effects of fucoidan can be recapitulated by inhibiting ERBB3 by either a specific shRNA or a novel, selective ERBB3 neutralizing antibody, reiterating the key roles played by this receptor in melanoma. We therefore propose the use of lapatinib or specific ERBB inhibitors, in combination with fucoidan as a new treatment of melanoma that potentiates the effects of the inhibitors while protecting from their potential side effects.

28060734	Let-7a regulates expression of β1-adrenoceptors and forms a negative feedback circuit with the β1-adrenoceptor signaling pathway in chronic ischemic heart failure.	BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of microRNA (miRNA) let-7a in down-regulation of β1-adrenoceptors (β1-AR) and elucidate the underlying mechanism of chronic ischemia heart failure (CIHF) in rats.METHODS AND RESULTS: CIHF model was established by occlusion of coronary artery for 4 weeks. β1-AR level was obviously down-regulated and let-7a up-regulated in the failing heart 4 weeks after myocardial infarction. Overexpression of let-7a inhibited β1-AR expression in neonatal rat ventricular cells (NRVCs), which was abolished by anti-let-7a antisense inhibitor. The lentivirus vector containing precursor let-7a (len-pre-let-7a) further down-regulated the reduced β1-AR level by CIHF and the effect was reversed by len-AMO-let-7a. Len-negative control did not produce any significant influence on β1-AR expression. Importantly, there exists a negative feedback loop associated with β1-AR regulation through β1-AR/cAMP/PKA/GATA4/let-7a/β1-AR signaling pathway in CIHF. As demonstrated, GATA4 was activated by β1-AR up-regulation through cAMP-PKA signaling pathway in early phase of ischemia, then GATA4 positively regulated let-7a expression which in turn suppressed β1-AR expression.CONCLUSIONS: Let-7a regulates β1-AR expression and forms a negative feedback loop with β1-AR signaling pathway in ischemic heart failure. This study provides a new insight into the differential expression of β1-AR in early and later phase of myocardial ischemia.	NA	0
28060733	High expression of miR-105-1 positively correlates with clinical prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting oncogene NCOA1.	Increasing evidence supports that microRNA (miRNA) plays a significant functional role in cancer progression by directly regulating respective targets. In this study, the expression levels of miR-105-1 and its target gene were analyzed using genes microarray and hierarchical clustering analysis followed by validation with quantitative RT-PCR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and normal liver tissues. We examined the expression of nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (NCOA1), the potential target gene of miR-105-1, following the transfection of miR-105-1 mimics or inhibitors. Our results showed that miR-105-1 was downregulated in HCC tissues when compared with normal liver tissues and patients with lower miR-105-1 expression had shorter overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). Moreover, NCOA1 was confirmed to be a direct target of miR-105-1. Furthermore, concomitant high expression of NCOA1 and low expression of miR-105-1 correlated with a shorter median OS and PFS in HCC patients. In conclusion, our results provide the first evidence that NCOA1 is a direct target of miR-105-1 suggesting that NCOA1 and miR-105-1 may have potential prognostic value and may be useful as tumor biomarkers for the diagnosis of HCC patients.

28060732	Prognostic impact of CD73 and A2A adenosine receptor expression in non-small-cell lung cancer.	In immune cells, CD73 dephosphorylates and converts extracellular AMP into adenosine, which binds the A2A adenosine receptor (A2AR). Blockade of this interaction, which induces an immunosuppressed niche in the tumor microenvironment, represents a potential novel treatment strategy. The clinical significance of CD73 and A2AR expression in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however, has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Here we evaluated CD73 and A2AR protein expression levels using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays containing 642 resected NSCLC specimens. Furthermore, we compared the expression profiles of 133 paired primary tumors and lymph node metastases. CD73 and A2AR expression levels were significantly higher in females than in males, in never smokers than in ever smokers, and in adenocarcinomas than in squamous cell carcinomas. Among adenocarcinomas, significantly higher CD73 and A2AR expression was observed in TTF-1-positive and mutant EGFR-positive tumors than in their counterparts. Compared with CD73, A2AR expression was more inconsistent between primary tumors and lymph node metastases. Among NSCLC patients, high CD73 expression was an independent indicator of poor prognosis in multivariate Cox regression analyses for overall survival [hazard ratio (HR), 2.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.38-3.46] and recurrence-free survival (HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.42-2.95). In contrast, high A2AR expression was an independent predictor of favorable prognosis for overall survival (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.98) and recurrence-free survival (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56-0.97). Together, these findings indicate that CD73 and A2AR have opposing prognostic effects, although cases involving CD73 or A2AR expression share some clinicopathological features.	NA	2
28060731	Folate intake, serum folate levels and esophageal cancer risk: an overall and dose-response meta-analysis.	Previously reported findings on the association between folate intake or serum folate levels and esophageal cancer risk have been inconsistent. This study aims to summarize the evidence regarding these relationships using a dose-response meta-analysis approach. We performed electronic searches of the Pubmed, Medline and Cochrane Library electronic databases to identify studies examining the effect of folate on the risk of esophageal cancer. Ultimately, 19 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Summary odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using a random effects model. A linear regression analysis of the natural logarithm of the OR was carried out to assess the possible dose-response relationship between folate intake and esophageal cancer risk. The pooled ORs for esophageal cancer in the highest vs. lowest levels of dietary folate intake and serum folate were 0.63 (95% CI: 0.56-0.71) and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.55-0.92), respectively. The dose-response meta-analysis indicated that a 100 μg/day increment in dietary folate intake reduced the estimate risk of esophageal cancer by 12%. These findings suggest that dietary and serum folate exert a protective effect against esophageal carcinogenesis.	NA	0
28060730	Prognostic value of microRNAs in osteosarcoma: A meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy. We meta-analyzed the prognostic value of altered miRNAs in patients with osteosarcoma.METHODS: Sources from MEDLINE (from inception to August 2016) and EMBASE (from inception to August 2016) were searched. Studies of osteosarcoma with results of miRNA and studies that reported survival data were included and two authors performed the data extraction independently. Any discrepancies were resolved by a consensus. The outcome was overall survival and event-free survival assessed using hazard ratios (HRs).RESULTS: After reviewing the full text of 65 articles, 25 studies including 2,278 patients were eligible in this study. The pooled HR for deaths was 1.40 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.94, p=0.04) with random-effects model (χ2=113.08, p&lt;0.00001, I2=79%) for patients of osteosarcoma with lower expression of miRNA. However, the pooled HR for events was not significant (HR 0.97, 0.63-1.48, p=0.87, χ2=72.65, p&lt;0.00001, I2=79%). In pathway analysis of miRNAs, miRNA449a, 199-5p, 542-5p have common target genes.CONCLUSIONS: Expression level of miRNA in patients of osteosarcoma is important as a prognostic factor.	NA	2
28060729	Blockade of the malignant phenotype by β-subunit selective noncovalent inhibition of immuno- and constitutive proteasomes.	A structure-based virtual screening of over 400,000 small molecules against the constitutive proteasome activity followed by in vitro assays led to the discovery of a family of proteasome inhibitors with a sulfonyl piperazine scaffold. Some members of this family of small non-peptidic inhibitors were found to act selectively on the β2 trypsin-like catalytic site with a preference for the immunoproteasome β2i over the constitutive proteasome β2c, while some act on the β5 site and post-acid site β1 of both, the immunoproteasome and the constitutive proteasome. Anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects on tumor cells were investigated and observed for two compounds. We report novel chemical inhibitors able to interfere with the three types of active centers of both, the immuno- and constitutive proteasomes. Identifying and analyzing a novel scaffold with decorations able to shift the binders' active site selectivity is essential to design a future generation of proteasome inhibitors able to distinguish the immunoproteasome from the constitutive proteasome.

28060728	Influence of EGFR mutational status on metastatic behavior in non squamous non small cell lung cancer.	Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutated Non Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLCs) are a molecularly subgroup of patients with peculiar clinic-pathological characteristics. Previous studies have suggested a possible interaction between oncogene status and metastatic behavior in non squamous NSCLCs with conflicting results. The aim of this study was to compare the different metastatic patterns, at baseline and during the course of the disease, in a cohort of 137 Caucasian patients with non-squamous NSCLC according to the EGFR mutational status and survival differences according to the different metastatic behavior. We observed unique metastatic distributions between EGFR-mutated and EGFR wild type non-squamous NSCLCs. These data support the hypothesis that tumor bio-molecular characteristics and genotype may influence the metastatic process in NSCLC and might help the development of enrichment strategies for tumor genotyping in these tumors, especially in the presence of limited tissue availability.

28060727	Associations between genetic variants in immunoregulatory genes and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a Chinese population.	We undertook a hospital-based case-control study to examine the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in selected immunoregulatory genes and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) risk in a Chinese population. One hundred and sixty-nine NHL patients diagnosed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2001 standard and 421 controls were recruited. Nine SNPs in three genes (IL-10, IL-1RN, and TNF-α) were selected based on predicted functions and previous study findings. Genetic association analysis was performed using the Cochran-Armitage trend test and multiple logistic regression. Four SNPs were associated with an increased risk of overall NHL: odds ratio per minor allele [ORper-minor-allele] and 95% confidence interval [CI] were 2.64 (1.75-3.98) for IL-10 rs1800893, 2.67 (1.72-4.16) for IL-1RN rs4251961, 1.80 (1.24-2.63) for TNF- α rs1800630, and 1.55 (1.02-2.37) for TNF- α rs2229094. These SNPs were also associated with an increased risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In addition, another SNP (TNF- α rs1041981) was associated with an increased risk of DLBCL (ORper-minor-allele=1.73, 95% CI 1.14-2.61). The findings provide evidence on the role of these immunoregulatory gene variants in NHL etiology.	NA	2
28060726	Immunogenic cancer cell death selectively induced by near infrared photoimmunotherapy initiates host tumor immunity.	Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a form of cell death that activates an adaptive immune response against dead-cell-associated antigens. Cancer cells killed via ICD can elicit antitumor immunity. ICD is efficiently induced by near-infrared photo-immunotherapy (NIR-PIT) that selectively kills target-cells on which antibody-photoabsorber conjugates bind and are activated by NIR light exposure. Advanced live cell microscopies showed that NIR-PIT caused rapid and irreversible damage to the cell membrane function leading to swelling and bursting, releasing intracellular components due to the influx of water into the cell. The process also induces relocation of ICD bio markers including calreticulin, Hsp70 and Hsp90 to the cell surface and the rapid release of immunogenic signals including ATP and HMGB1 followed by maturation of immature dendritic cells. Thus, NIR-PIT is a therapy that kills tumor cells by ICD, eliciting a host immune response against tumor.	NA	0
28060725	Identification and characterization of novel PAX8 mutations in Congenital Hypothyroidism(CH) in a Chinese population.	OBJECTIVE: Based on mutations in PAX8 is associated with thyroid dysgenesis. We aim to identify and characterize PAX8 mutations in a large cohort of congenital hypothyroidism(CH) from thyroid dysgenesis in Chinese population.METHODS: We screened 453 unrelated Chinese patients with CH from thyroid dysgenesis for PAX8 mutations by sequencing the whole coding regions of PAX8 on genomic DNA isolated from blood. Cell transfection assays using various vector constructs and induced mutagenesis as well as electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to investigate the effects of selected mutations on the transcribing and binding activities of PAX8 at the promoters of target genes for thyroglobulin (TG) and thyroperoxidase (TPO).RESULTS: Five PAX8 mutations were found, yielding a mutation prevalence of 5/453 (1.1%). We selected two mutations in the critical paired domain of PAX8 and generated mutants D94N and G41V. We demonstrated G41V was unable to bind the specific sequence in the promoters of TG and TPO and activate them. D94N could bind to TG and TPO promoters and normally activate the TG promoter transcription but not the TPO promoter transcription. We also demonstrated a dominant negative role of the PAX8 mutants in impairing the function of the wild-type PAX8.CONCLUSION: We for the first time documented the prevalence and characterized the function of PAX8 mutations in CH in Chinese population. The study specifically demonstrated the role of novel mutations D94N and G41V in impairing the function of PAX8, providing further evidence for genetic PAX8 defects as a disease mechanism in CH.	NA	0
28060724	Large-scale DNA methylation expression analysis across 12 solid cancers reveals hypermethylation in the calcium-signaling pathway.	Tumorigenesis is linked to the role of DNA methylation in gene expression regulation. Yet, cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease in which the global pattern of DNA methylation and gene expression, especially across diverse cancers, is not well understood. We investigated DNA methylation status and its association with gene expressions across 12 solid cancer types obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Results showed that global hypermethylation was an important characteristic across all 12 cancer types. Moreover, there were more epigenetically silenced than epigenetically activated genes across the cancers. Further analysis identified epigenetically silenced genes shared in the calcium-signaling pathway across the different cancer types. Reversing the aberrant DNA methylation of genes involved in the calcium-signaling pathway could be an effective strategy for suppressing cancers and developing anti-cancer drugs.	NA	2
28060723	The effect of androgen receptor expression on clinical characterization of metastatic breast cancer.	In breast cancer (BC), androgen receptor (AR) expression is related to estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PgR) expression. AR expression is an indicator of good prognosis in breast cancer regardless of hormone receptor (HR) status. In this study, we evaluated the effect of AR-related gene expression on clinical characterization of metastatic BC. We performed RNA-Seq to evaluate gene expression using mRNA extracted from 37 patients with metastatic BC. Intrinsic subtype prediction, analysis of differential gene expression, and gene set enrichment pathway analysis were then performed. Metastatic BCs were categorized into three subgroups based on AR, ER, PgR, and HER2 expression. According to this subcategorization, 70 genes including AR, ER, and HER2 were differentially expressed among the three groups. In gene set enrichment pathway analysis, the low AR group was associated with the cell cycle pathway, whereas mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways was prevalent in the high ER and AR group. In survival analysis, a higher level of AR expression correlated with prolonged overall survival in metastatic BC (high expression vs. low expression, median OS 53.1 vs. 27.2 months, p=.001). In conclusion, we propose that AR and AR-related gene expression could be utilized to predict the prognosis of metastatic BC and thus may be useful in treatment planning for refractory BC.	NA	2
28060722	Polyphyllin I induces mitophagic and apoptotic cell death in human breast cancer cells by increasing mitochondrial PINK1 levels.	The molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-breast cancer effects of polyphyllin I, a natural compound extracted from Paris polyphylla rhizomes, are not fully understood. In the present study, we found that polyphyllin I induces mitochondrial translocation of DRP1 by dephosphorylating DRP1 at Ser637, leading to mitochondrial fission, cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol and, ultimately apoptosis. Polyphyllin I also increased the stabilization of full-length PINK1 at the mitochondrial surface, leading to the recruitment of PARK2, P62, ubiquitin, and LC3B-II to mitochondria and culminating in mitophagy. PINK1 knockdown markedly suppressed polyphyllin I-induced mitophagy and enhanced polyphyllin I-induced, DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fission and apoptosis. Furthermore, suppression of DRP1 by mdivi-1 or shRNA inhibited PINK1 knockdown/polyphyllin I-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis, suggesting that PINK1 depletion leads to excessive fission and, subsequently, mitochondrial fragmentation. An in vivo study confirmed that polyphyllin I greatly inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 xenografts, and these effects were enhanced by PINK1 knockdown. These data describe the mechanism by which PINK1 contributes to polyphyllin I-induced mitophagy and apoptosis and suggest that polyphyllin I may be an effective drug for breast cancer treatment.	NA	0
28060721	DPPIV promotes endometrial carcinoma cell proliferation, invasion and tumorigenesis.	Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), also known as CD26, is a 110-kDa cell surface glycoprotein expressed in various tissues. DPPIV reportedly plays a direct role in the progression of several human malignancies. DPPIV specific inhibitors are employed as antidiabetics and could potentially be repurposed to enhance anti-tumor immunotherapies. In the present study, we investigated the correlation between DPPIV expression and tumor progression in endometrial carcinoma (EC). DPPIV overexpression altered cell morphology and stimulated cell proliferation, invasion and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. These effects were abrogated by DPPIV knockdown or pharmacological inhibition using sitagliptin. DPPIV overexpression increased hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF-1a) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression to promote HIF-1a-VEGFA signaling. Our results indicated that DPPIV accelerated endometrial carcinoma progression and that sitagliptin may be an effective anti-EC therapeutic.	NA	0
28060958	Elevated Bone Turnover Markers after Risk-Reducing Salpingo-Oophorectomy in Women at Increased Risk for Breast and Ovarian Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) reduces ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Premenopausal RRSO is hypothesized to increase fracture risk more than natural menopause. Elevated bone turnover markers (BTMs) might predict fracture risk. We investigated BTM levels after RRSO and aimed to identify clinical characteristics associated with elevated BTMs.METHODS: Osteocalcin (OC), procollagen type I N-terminal peptide (PINP) and serum C-telopeptide of type I collagen (sCTx) were measured in 210 women ≥ 2 years after RRSO before age 53. BTM Z-scores were calculated using an existing reference cohort of age-matched women. Clinical characteristics were assessed by questionnaire.RESULTS: BTMs after RRSO were higher than age-matched reference values: median Z-scores OC 0.11, p = 0.003; PINP 0.84, p &lt; 0.001; sCTx 0.53, p &lt; 0.001 (compared to Z = 0). After excluding women with recent fractures or BTM interfering medication, Z-scores increased to 0.34, 1.14 and 0.88, respectively. Z-scores for OC and PINP were inversely correlated to age at RRSO. No correlation was found with fracture incidence or history of breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Five years after RRSO, BTMs were higher than age-matched reference values. Since elevated BTMs might predict higher fracture risk, prospective studies are required to evaluate the clinical implications of this finding.	NA	0
28060956	Technical Insights into Highly Sensitive Isolation and Molecular Characterization of Fixed and Live Circulating Tumor Cells for Early Detection of Tumor Invasion.	Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) and Circulating Tumor Microemboli (CTM) are Circulating Rare Cells (CRC) which herald tumor invasion and are expected to provide an opportunity to improve the management of cancer patients. An unsolved technical issue in the CTC field is how to obtain highly sensitive and unbiased collection of these fragile and heterogeneous cells, in both live and fixed form, for their molecular study when they are extremely rare, particularly at the beginning of the invasion process. We report on a new protocol to enrich from blood live CTC using ISET® (Isolation by SizE of Tumor/Trophoblastic Cells), an open system originally developed for marker-independent isolation of fixed tumor cells. We have assessed the impact of our new enrichment method on live tumor cells antigen expression, cytoskeleton structure, cell viability and ability to expand in culture. We have also explored the ISET® in vitro performance to collect intact fixed and live cancer cells by using spiking analyses with extremely low number of fluorescent cultured cells. We describe results consistently showing the feasibility of isolating fixed and live tumor cells with a Lower Limit of Detection (LLOD) of one cancer cell per 10 mL of blood and a sensitivity at LLOD ranging from 83 to 100%. This very high sensitivity threshold can be maintained when plasma is collected before tumor cells isolation. Finally, we have performed a comparative next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of tumor cells before and after isolation from blood and culture. We established the feasibility of NGS analysis of single live and fixed tumor cells enriched from blood by our system. This study provides new protocols for detection and characterization of CTC collected from blood at the very early steps of tumor invasion.	NA	2
28060954	Activation of the mTOR Pathway by Oxaliplatin in the Treatment of Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis.	BACKGROUND: Standard of care treatment for colorectal cancer liver metastasis consists of a cytotoxic chemotherapy in combination with a targeted agent. Clinical trials have guided the use of these combinatory therapies, but it remains unclear what the optimal combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapy with a targeted agent are.METHODS: Using a genomic based approach, gene expression profiling was obtained from tumor samples of patient with colorectal cancer liver metastasis who received an oxaliplatin based therapy. Early passaged colorectal cancer liver metastasis cell lines and patient derived xenografts of colorectal cancer liver metastasis were then treated with oxaliplatin and a mTOR inhibitor.RESULTS: Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the mTOR pathway was activated in patients receiving oxaliplatin based therapy. Treatment of early passaged colorectal cancer lines and patient derived xenografts with oxaliplatin resulted in activation of the mTOR pathway. Combination therapy with oxaliplatin and a mTOR inhibitor resulted in a synergistic effect both in vitro and in vivo.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a genomic based approach can be used to identify optimal combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapy with a targeted agent and that these observations can be validated both in vitro and in vivo using patient derived colorectal cancer cell lines and patient derived xenografts prior to clinical use.

28060948	Weight Loss and Mortality in Overweight and Obese Cancer Survivors: A Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND: Excess adiposity is a risk factor for poorer cancer survival, but there is uncertainty over whether losing weight reduces the risk. We conducted a critical review of the literature examining weight loss and mortality in overweight or obese cancer survivors.METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and EMBASE for articles reporting associations between weight loss and mortality (cancer-specific or all-cause) in overweight/obese patients with obesity-related cancers. Where available, data from the same studies on non-overweight patients were compared.RESULTS: Five articles describing observational studies in breast cancer survivors were included. Four studies reported a positive association between weight loss and mortality in overweight/obese survivors, and the remaining study observed no significant association. Results were similar for non-overweight survivors. Quality assessment indicated high risk of bias across studies.CONCLUSIONS: There is currently a lack of observational evidence that weight loss improves survival for overweight and obese cancer survivors. However, the potential for bias in these studies is considerable and the results likely reflect the consequences of disease-related rather than intentional weight loss. There is a need for stronger study designs, incorporating measures of intentionality of weight loss, and extended to other cancers.	NA	0
28060918	The Impact of the Duration of Adjuvant Chemotherapy on Survival in Patients with Epithelial Ovarian Cancer - A Retrospective Study.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic role of the duration of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer (EOC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Within the present study we retrospectively evaluated the data of 165 consecutive patients with EOC treated with primary surgery followed by six completed cycles of platinum-taxan based intravenous adjuvant chemotherapy. Medians of total duration of chemotherapy were compared with clinical-pathological parameters. Patients were stratified into four risk groups according to the delay in days of total duration of chemotherapy, and univariate and multivariable survival analyses were performed.RESULTS: The median duration of six completed cycles of chemotherapy comprised 113 days (IQR 107-124 days). Uni- and multivariable survival analyses revealed a delay of total duration of chemotherapy of at least 9 days to be associated with progression-free (PFS), cancer-specific (CSS) and overall survival (OS). Hazard ratios (HR), confidence intervals (95% CI) and p-values for PFS, CSS and OS due to delay of chemo-duration were 2.9 (1.6-5.4; p = 0.001), 2.9 (1.3-6.2; p = 0.008) and 2.6 (1.3-5.4; p = 0.008), respectively. Prolonged total chemo-duration was associated with the amount of postoperative residual disease (p = 0.001) and the patients' age (p = 0.03).CONCLUSION: The present study suggests a prolonged duration of adjuvant chemotherapy after primary surgery to adversely affect PFS, CSS and OS in patients with EOC. Yet larger studies are required to validate our results.	NA	0
28060891	Performance of 89Zr-Labeled-Rituximab-PET as an Imaging Biomarker to Assess CD20 Targeting: A Pilot Study in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma.	PURPOSE: Treatment of patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) includes rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Insufficient tumor targeting might cause therapy failure. Tumor uptake of 89Zirconium (89Zr)-mAb is a potential imaging biomarker for tumor targeting, since it depends on target antigen expression and accessibility. The aim of this pilot study was to describe the performance of 89Zr-labeled-rituximab-PET to assess CD20 targeting in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL.METHODS: Six patients with biopsy-proven DLBCL were included. CD20 expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC). 74 MBq 89Zr-rituximab (10 mg) was administered after the therapeutic dose of rituximab. Immuno-PET scans on day 0, 3 and 6 post injection (D0, D3 and D6 respectively) were visually assessed and quantified for tumor uptake.RESULTS: Tumor uptake of 89Zr-rituximab and CD20 expression were concordant in 5 patients: for one patient, both were negative, for the other four patients visible tumor uptake was concordant with CD20-positive biopsies. Intense tumor uptake of 89Zr-rituximab on PET (SUVpeak = 12.8) corresponded with uniformly positive CD20 expression on IHC in one patient. Moderate tumor uptake of 89Zr-rituximab (range SUVpeak = 3.2-5.4) corresponded with positive CD20 expression on IHC in three patients. In one patient tumor uptake of 89Zr-rituximab was observed (SUVpeak = 3.8), while the biopsy was CD20-negative.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a positive correlation between tumor uptake of 89Zr-rituximab and CD20 expression in tumor biopsies, but further studies are needed to confirm this. This result supports the potential of 89Zr-rituximab-PET as an imaging biomarker for CD20 targeting. For clinical application of 89Zr-rituximab-PET to guide individualized treatment, further studies are required to assess whether tumor targeting is related to clinical benefit of rituximab treatment in individual patients.

28060889	Sequential PET/CT with [18F]-FDG Predicts Pathological Tumor Response to Preoperative Short Course Radiotherapy with Delayed Surgery in Patients with Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Using Logistic Regression Analysis.	Previous studies indicate that FDG PET/CT may predict pathological response in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Aim of the current study is evaluate if pathological response can be similarly predicted in LARC patients after short course radiation therapy alone.METHODS: Thirty-three patients with cT2-3, N0-2, M0 rectal adenocarcinoma treated with hypo fractionated short course neoadjuvant RT (5x5 Gy) with delayed surgery (SCRTDS) were prospectively studied. All patients underwent 3 PET/CT studies at baseline, 10 days from RT end (early), and 53 days from RT end (delayed). Maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax), mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of the primary tumor were measured and recorded at each PET/CT study. We use logistic regression analysis to aggregate different measures of metabolic response to predict the pathological response in the course of SCRTDS.RESULTS: We provide straightforward formulas to classify response and estimate the probability of being a major responder (TRG1-2) or a complete responder (TRG1) for each individual. The formulas are based on the level of TLG at the early PET and on the overall proportional reduction of TLG between baseline and delayed PET studies.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that in the course of SCRTDS it is possible to estimate the probabilities of pathological tumor responses on the basis of PET/CT with FDG. Our formulas make it possible to assess the risks associated to LARC borne by a patient in the course of SCRTDS. These risk assessments can be balanced against other health risks associated with further treatments and can therefore be used to make informed therapy adjustments during SCRTDS.	NA	0
28060884	Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound with VEGFR2-Targeted Microbubbles for Monitoring Regorafenib Therapy Effects in Experimental Colorectal Adenocarcinomas in Rats with DCE-MRI and Immunohistochemical Validation.	OBJECTIVES: To investigate contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with VEGFR2-targeted microbubbles for monitoring therapy effects of regorafenib on experimental colon carcinomas in rats with correlation to dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and immunohistochemistry.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human colorectal adenocarcinoma xenografts (HT-29) were implanted subcutaneously in n = 21 (n = 11 therapy group; n = 10 control group) female athymic nude rats (Hsd: RH-Foxn1rnu). Animals were imaged at baseline and after a one-week daily treatment with regorafenib or a placebo (10 mg/kg bodyweight), using CEUS with VEGFR2-targeted microbubbles and DCE-MRI. In CEUS tumor perfusion was assessed during an early vascular phase (wash-in area under the curve = WiAUC) and VEGFR2-specific binding during a late molecular phase (signal intensity after 8 (SI8min) and 10 minutes (SI10min)), using a conventional 15L8 linear transducer (transmit frequency 7 MHz, dynamic range 80 dB, depth 25 mm). In DCE-MRI functional parameters plasma flow (PF) and plasma volume (PV) were quantified. For validation purposes, CEUS parameters were correlated with DCE-MRI parameters and immunohistochemical VEGFR2, CD31, Ki-67 and TUNEL stainings.RESULTS: CEUS perfusion parameter WiAUC decreased significantly (116,989 ± 77,048 a.u. to 30,076 ± 27,095a.u.; p = 0.005) under therapy with no significant changes (133,932 ± 65,960 a.u. to 84,316 ± 74,144 a.u.; p = 0.093) in the control group. In the therapy group, the amount of bound microbubbles in the late phase was significantly lower in the therapy than in the control group on day 7 (SI8min: 283 ± 191 vs. 802 ± 460 a.u.; p = 0.006); SI10min: 226 ± 149 vs. 645 ± 461 a.u.; p = 0.009). PF and PV decreased significantly (PF: 147 ± 58 mL/100 mL/min to 71 ± 15 mL/100 mL/min; p = 0.003; PV: 13 ± 3% to 9 ± 4%; p = 0.040) in the therapy group. Immunohistochemistry revealed significantly fewer VEGFR2 (7.2 ± 1.8 vs. 17.8 ± 4.6; p &lt; 0.001), CD31 (8.1 ± 3.0 vs. 20.8 ± 5.7; p &lt; 0.001) and Ki-67 (318.7 ± 94.0 vs. 468.0 ± 133.8; p = 0.004) and significantly more TUNEL (672.7 ± 194.0 vs. 357.6 ± 192.0; p = 0.003) positive cells in the therapy group. CEUS parameters showed significant (p &lt; 0.05) correlations to DCE-MRI parameters and immunohistochemistry.CONCLUSIONS: CEUS with VEGFR2-targeted microbubbles allowed for monitoring regorafenib functional and molecular therapy effects on experimental colorectal adenocarcinomas with a significant decline of CEUS and DCE-MRI perfusion parameters as well as a significant reduction of specifically bound microbubbles under therapy, consistent with a reduced expression of VEGFR2.

28060870	Selective Inhibitors of Histone Deacetylases 1 and 2 Synergize with Azacitidine in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by defects in myeloid differentiation and increased proliferation of neoplastic hematopoietic precursor cells. Outcomes for patients with AML remain poor, highlighting the need for novel treatment options. Aberrant epigenetic regulation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AML, and inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase or histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes have exhibited activity in preclinical AML models. Combination studies with HDAC inhibitors plus DNA methyltransferase inhibitors have potential beneficial clinical activity in AML, however the toxicity profiles of non-selective HDAC inhibitors in the combination setting limit their clinical utility. In this work, we describe the preclinical development of selective inhibitors of HDAC1 and HDAC2, which are hypothesized to have improved safety profiles, for combination therapy in AML. We demonstrate that selective inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC2 is sufficient to achieve efficacy both as a single agent and in combination with azacitidine in preclinical models of AML, including established AML cell lines, primary leukemia cells from AML patient bone marrow samples and in vivo xenograft models of human AML. Gene expression profiling of AML cells treated with either an HDAC1/2 inhibitor, azacitidine, or the combination of both have identified a list of genes involved in transcription and cell cycle regulation as potential mediators of the combinatorial effects of HDAC1/2 inhibition with azacitidine. Together, these findings support the clinical evaluation of selective HDAC1/2 inhibitors in combination with azacitidine in AML patients.	NA	0
28060807	SVM and SVM Ensembles in Breast Cancer Prediction.	Breast cancer is an all too common disease in women, making how to effectively predict it an active research problem. A number of statistical and machine learning techniques have been employed to develop various breast cancer prediction models. Among them, support vector machines (SVM) have been shown to outperform many related techniques. To construct the SVM classifier, it is first necessary to decide the kernel function, and different kernel functions can result in different prediction performance. However, there have been very few studies focused on examining the prediction performances of SVM based on different kernel functions. Moreover, it is unknown whether SVM classifier ensembles which have been proposed to improve the performance of single classifiers can outperform single SVM classifiers in terms of breast cancer prediction. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to fully assess the prediction performance of SVM and SVM ensembles over small and large scale breast cancer datasets. The classification accuracy, ROC, F-measure, and computational times of training SVM and SVM ensembles are compared. The experimental results show that linear kernel based SVM ensembles based on the bagging method and RBF kernel based SVM ensembles with the boosting method can be the better choices for a small scale dataset, where feature selection should be performed in the data pre-processing stage. For a large scale dataset, RBF kernel based SVM ensembles based on boosting perform better than the other classifiers.	NA	0
28057664	Incidence and management of diarrhea in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with pertuzumab.	BACKGROUND: Pertuzumab disrupts heterodimerization between human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER3, and HER4. Thus, pertuzumab could result in adverse events similar to those observed with EGFR antagonists, such as diarrhea. We report the incidence and severity of diarrhea observed with pertuzumab in the CLEOPATRA, NeoSphere, and TRYPHAENA studies.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n=1443) had metastatic (CLEOPATRA [n=804]) or early-stage breast cancer (NeoSphere [n=416] and TRYPHAENA [n=223]). The incidence and severity of diarrhea were analyzed by treatment received. The incidence of febrile neutropenia concurrent with diarrhea and the effect of pre-existing gastrointestinal comorbidities were also evaluated. Subgroup analyses were performed using CLEOPATRA data.RESULTS: The incidence of all-grade diarrhea across studies was generally greater for pertuzumab-based treatment, ranging from 28%-72% (grade 1, 21%-54%; grade 2, 8%-37%; grade 3, 0%-12%; grade 4, 0%). Incidence was highest during the first pertuzumab-containing cycle, decreasing with subsequent cycles. Dose delays or discontinuations due to diarrhea were infrequent, ranging from 0%-8%. Among pertuzumab-treated patients with diarrhea, 47%-67% received pharmacological intervention, most commonly with loperamide. Overlap between diarrhea and febrile neutropenia was uncommon, ranging from 0%-11%. No relationship was observed between pre-existing gastrointestinal comorbidities and diarrhea. In CLEOPATRA, patients ≥65 years treated with pertuzumab had a higher incidence of grade 3 diarrhea than patients &lt;65 years (19% vs 8%). All-grade diarrhea occurred at greater frequency among pertuzumab-treated Asian versus white patients with metastatic breast cancer (74% vs 63%); the corresponding rates in the control arm were 53% and 45%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: In both the metastatic and early-stage breast cancer settings, diarrhea was common but manageable for all pertuzumab-containing regimens. Diarrheal episodes were mainly low grade and occurred most often during the first treatment cycle. Diarrheal-related drug delays or discontinuations were uncommon. : ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00567190 (CLEOPATRA), NCT00545688 (NeoSphere), NCT00976989 (TRYPHAENA).	NA	0
28057663	PARP inhibitor and chemotherapy combination trials for the treatment of advanced malignancies: does a development pathway forward exist?	Poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor combinations are currently being explored as a treatment strategy for advanced cancers with some or no known DNA repair deficits in order to increase the anti-cancer potential of both the PARP inhibitor and the chemotherapy partner. However, overlapping myelosuppression necessitating lowering of the PARP inhibitor and chemotherapy doses has unknown effects on efficacy. In addition, establishment of pre-clinical efficacy will be critical in moving these combinations rationally forward for further clinical development. In this editorial, we review the mechanisms of action of PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy combinations, the clinical trials that have been performed and reported on thus far, and then discuss the challenges ahead for clinical development of these combinations.

28057939	Activating JAK2 mutants reveal cytokine receptor coupling differences that impact outcomes in myeloproliferative neoplasm.	Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK2) mediates downstream signaling of cytokine receptors in all hematological lineages, yet constitutively active JAK2 mutants are able to drive selective expansion of particular lineage(s) in myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). The molecular basis of lineage specificity is unclear. Here we show that three activating JAK2 mutants with similar kinase activities in vitro elicit distinctive MPN phenotypes in mice by differentially expanding erythroid vs. granulocytic precursors. Molecularly, this reflects the differential binding of JAK2 mutants to cytokine receptors EpoR and GCSFR in the erythroid vs granulocytic lineage and the creation of unique receptor/JAK2 complexes that generate qualitatively distinct downstream signals. Our results demonstrate that activating JAK2 mutants can differentially couple to selective cytokine receptors and change the signaling repertoire, revealing the molecular basis for phenotypic differences elicited by JAK2(V617F) or mutations in exon 12. Based on these findings, receptor-JAK2 interactions could represent new targets of lineage-specific therapeutic approaches against MPN, which may be applicable to other cancers with aberrant JAK-STAT signaling.Leukemia accepted article preview online, 06 January 2017. doi:10.1038/leu.2017.1.

28057866	Evidence for opposing roles of Celsr3 and Vangl2 in glutamatergic synapse formation.	The signaling mechanisms that choreograph the assembly of the highly asymmetric pre- and postsynaptic structures are still poorly defined. Using synaptosome fractionation, immunostaining, and coimmunoprecipitation, we found that Celsr3 and Vangl2, core components of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, are localized at developing glutamatergic synapses and interact with key synaptic proteins. Pyramidal neurons from the hippocampus of Celsr3 knockout mice exhibit loss of ∼50% of glutamatergic synapses, but not inhibitory synapses, in culture. Wnts are known regulators of synapse formation, and our data reveal that Wnt5a inhibits glutamatergic synapses formed via Celsr3. To avoid affecting earlier developmental processes, such as axon guidance, we conditionally knocked out Celsr3 in the hippocampus 1 week after birth. The CA1 neurons that lost Celsr3 also showed a loss of ∼50% of glutamatergic synapses in vivo without affecting the inhibitory synapses assessed by miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) and electron microscopy. These animals displayed deficits in hippocampus-dependent behaviors in adulthood, including spatial learning and memory and fear conditioning. In contrast to Celsr3 conditional knockouts, we found that the conditional knockout of Vangl2 in the hippocampus 1 week after birth led to a large increase in synaptic density, as evaluated by mEPSC frequency and spine density. PCP signaling is mediated by multiple core components with antagonizing functions. Our results document the opposing roles of Celsr3 and Vangl2 in glutamatergic synapse formation.	NA	0
28057861	Cellular context-dependent consequences of Apc mutations on gene regulation and cellular behavior.	The spectrum of genetic mutations differs among cancers in different organs, implying a cellular context-dependent effect for genetic aberrations. However, the extent to which the cellular context affects the consequences of oncogenic mutations remains to be fully elucidated. We reprogrammed colon tumor cells in an Apc(Min/+) (adenomatous polyposis coli) mouse model, in which the loss of the Apc gene plays a critical role in tumor development and subsequently, established reprogrammed tumor cells (RTCs) that exhibit pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-like signatures of gene expression. We show that the majority of the genes in RTCs that were affected by Apc mutations did not overlap with the genes affected in the intestine. RTCs lacked pluripotency but exhibited an increased expression of Cdx2 and a differentiation propensity that was biased toward the trophectoderm cell lineage. Genetic rescue of the mutated Apc allele conferred pluripotency on RTCs and enabled their differentiation into various cell types in vivo. The redisruption of Apc in RTC-derived differentiated cells resulted in neoplastic growth that was exclusive to the intestine, but the majority of the intestinal lesions remained as pretumoral microadenomas. These results highlight the significant influence of cellular context on gene regulation, cellular plasticity, and cellular behavior in response to the loss of the Apc function. Our results also imply that the transition from microadenomas to macroscopic tumors is reprogrammable, which underscores the importance of epigenetic regulation on tumor promotion.	NA	0
28061374	Catecholamines profiles at diagnosis: Increased diagnostic sensitivity and correlation with biological and clinical features in neuroblastoma patients.	INTRODUCTION: Neuroblastoma (NBL) accounts for 10% of the paediatric malignancies and is responsible for 15% of the paediatric cancer-related deaths. Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) are most commonly analysed in urine of NBL patients. However, their diagnostic sensitivity is suboptimal (82%). Therefore, we performed in-depth analysis of the diagnostic sensitivity of a panel of urinary catecholamine metabolites.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of a panel of 8 urinary catecholamine metabolites (VMA, HVA, 3-methoxytyramine [3MT], dopamine, epinephrine, metanephrine, norepinephrine and normetanephrine [NMN]) from 301 NBL patients at diagnosis. Special attention was given to subgroups, metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) non-avid tumours and VMA/HVA negative patients.RESULTS: Elevated catecholamine metabolites, especially 3MT, correlated with nine out of 12 NBL characteristics such as stage, age, MYCN amplification, loss of heterozygosity for 1p and bone-marrow invasion. The combination of the classical markers VMA and HVA had a diagnostic sensitivity of 84%. NMN was the most sensitive single diagnostic metabolite with overall sensitivity of 89%. When all 8 metabolites were combined, a diagnostic sensitivity of 95% was achieved. Among the VMA and HVA negative patients, were also 29% with stage 4 disease, which usually had elevation of other catecholamine metabolites (93%). Diagnostic sensitivity for patients with MIBG non-avid tumour was improved from 33% (VMA and/or HVA) to 89% by measuring the panel.CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that analysis of a urinary catecholamine metabolite panel, comprising 8 metabolites, ensures the highest sensitivity to diagnose NBL patients.

28056913	Prognostic relevance of lactate dehydrogenase in advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients.	BACKGROUND: The prognostic role of pretreatment serum lactate dehydronegase (LDH) has been well established in many malignant tumors, albeit it remains under-discussed in pancreatic cancer. In the present study, we aimed to assess the association between baseline LDH levels and overall survival (OS) in advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients who did and did not receive subsequent chemotherapy.METHODS: In total, 135 retrospectively determined patients with locally advanced or metastatic PDAC, who were diagnosed between 2012 and 2013, were analyzed. Baseline LDH levels were detected within 20 days after histopathological confirmation of the diagnosis. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was applied to estimate the adjusted hazards ratio (HR) for LDH levels and OS of PDAC. We used restricted cubic spline (RCS) to further investigate dose-effect relationship in the association.RESULTS: Having adjusted for possible confounders, we found that in advanced PDAC patients who went through subsequent chemotherapy, an elevated pretreatment LDH level (≥250 U/L) had an adjusted HR of 2.47 (95% CI = 1.28-4.77) for death, but patients, who did not receive chemotherapy, had no significant HR (adjusted HR = 1.57; 95% CI = 0.83-2.96). RCS fitting results revealed a steep increase in HR for PDAC patients received chemotherapy with a baseline LDH &gt; 500 U/L.CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment LDH levels had noticeable prognostic value in PDAC patients who received subsequent chemotherapy. Tackling elevated LDH levels before the initiation of chemotherapy might be a promising measure for improving OS of patients after treatment for their advanced PDAC. Studies with a large sample size and a prospective design are warranted to substantiate our findings.	NA	2

We used restricted cubic spline (RCS) to further investigate dose-effect relationship in the association.RESULTS: Having adjusted for possible confounders, we found that in advanced PDAC patients who went through subsequent chemotherapy, an elevated pretreatment LDH level (≥250 U/L) had an adjusted HR of 2.47 (95% CI = 1.28-4.77) for death, but patients, who did not receive chemotherapy, had no significant HR (adjusted HR = 1.57; 95% CI = 0.83-2.96). RCS fitting results revealed a steep increase in HR for PDAC patients received chemotherapy with a baseline LDH &gt; 500 U/L.CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment LDH levels had noticeable prognostic value in PDAC patients who received subsequent chemotherapy. Tackling elevated LDH levels before the initiation of chemotherapy might be a promising measure for improving OS of patients after treatment for their advanced PDAC. Studies with a large sample size and a prospective design are warranted to substantiate our findings.	NA	0
28056901	Expansion of the Milan criteria without any sacrifice: combination of the Hangzhou criteria with the pre-transplant platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio.	BACKGROUND: The Hangzhou criteria expand the Milan criteria safely and effectively in selecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) candidates for liver transplantation (LT), but some patients exceeding the Milan but fulfilling the Hangzhou criteria still show poor outcomes due to early tumor recurrence. In this study, the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) was employed to differentiate high-risk tumor recurrence recipients, and a new method combining PLR and the Hangzhou criteria was established.METHODS: The clinical data of 343 LT for HCC were retrospectively analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the PLR cut-off value to stratify patients exceeding the Milan but fulfilling the Hangzhou criteria. The recurrence-free survival (RFS) of recipients was compared after stratification. The Hangzhou criteria &amp; PLR method was proposed and its feasibility was validated by ROC analysis.RESULTS: PLR 120 was the most significant cut-off value when comparing RFS of patients exceeding the Milan but fulfilling the Hangzhou criteria. After stratification, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS of patients exceeding the Milan but fulfilling the Hangzhou criteria with PLR &lt; 120 were 84.2%, 73.3%, and 73.3%, respectively, comparable with 85.7%, 73.9%, and 72.8%, respectively, in patients fulfilling the Milan criteria (P = 0.885). Patients exceeding the Milan but fulfilling the Hangzhou criteria with PLR ≥ 120 showed poor outcomes, which were similar in patients exceeding the Hangzhou criteria; 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS were only 37.5%, 12.5%, and 12.5% vs. 32.3%, 17.6%, and 15.1%, respectively (P = 0.887). ROC analysis demonstrated that the ROC area of the Hangzhou criteria &amp; PLR method was 0.768 for RFS. Multivariate analysis confirmed that PLR ≥ 120 was independently associated with RFS of patients exceeding the Milan but fulfilling the Hangzhou criteria.CONCLUSIONS: The Hangzhou criteria combined with the pre-transplant PLR can accurately exclude high-risk tumor recurrence recipients; this approach expands the Milan criteria effectively without any sacrifice.

28056899	PGE2 promotes breast cancer-associated lymphangiogenesis by activation of EP4 receptor on lymphatic endothelial cells.	BACKGROUND: Lymphatic metastasis, facilitated by lymphangiogenesis is a common occurrence in breast cancer, the molecular mechanisms remaining incompletely understood. We had earlier shown that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression by human or murine breast cancer cells promoted lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis by upregulating VEGF-C/D production by tumor cells or tumor-associated macrophages primarily due to activation of the prostaglandin receptor EP4 by endogenous PGE2. It is not clear whether tumor or host-derived PGE2 has any direct effect on lymphangiogenesis, and if so, whether EP4 receptors on lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) play any role.METHODS: Here, we address these questions employing in vitro studies with a COX-2-expressing and VEGF-C/D-producing murine breast cancer cell line C3L5 and a rat mesenteric (RM) LEC line and in vivo studies in nude mice.RESULTS: RMLEC responded to PGE2, an EP4 agonist PGE1OH, or C3L5 cell-conditioned media (C3L5-CM) by increased proliferation, migration and accelerated tube formation on growth factor reduced Matrigel. Native tube formation by RMLEC on Matrigel was abrogated in the presence of a selective COX-2 inhibitor or an EP4 antagonist. Addition of PGE2 or EP4 agonist, or C3L5-CM individually in the presence of COX-2 inhibitor, or EP4 antagonist, restored tube formation, reinforcing the role of EP4 on RMLEC in tubulogenesis. These results were partially duplicated with a human dermal LEC (HMVEC-dLyAd) and a COX-2 expressing human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Knocking down EP4 with shRNA in RMLEC abrogated their tube forming capacity on Matrigel in the absence or presence of PGE2, EP4 agonist, or C3L5-CM. RMLEC tubulogenesis following EP4 activation by agonist treatment was dependent on PI3K/Akt and Erk signaling pathways and VEGFR-3 stimulation. Finally in a directed in vivo lymphangiogenesis assay (DIVLA) we demonstrated the lymphangiogenic as well as angiogenic capacity of PGE2 and EP4 agonist in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the roles of tumor as well as host-derived PGE2 in inducing lymphangiogenesis, at least in part, by activating EP4 and VEGFR-3 on LEC. EP4 being a common target on both tumor and host cells contributing to tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis reaffirms the therapeutic value of EP4 antagonists in the intervention of lymphatic metastasis in breast cancer.

28056887	Therapeutic vaccine targeting Epstein-Barr virus latent protein, LMP1, suppresses LMP1-expressing tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.	BACKGROUND: In endemic area, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) tumor cells harbor EBV latent infection and expresses viral antigens such as EBNA1, LMP1 and LMP2. In this study, we established a NPC-mimicry animal model and assessed the therapeutic potential of LMP1 vaccine.METHODS: Animal models were established by injection of LMP1-expressing TC-1 cells in C57BL6/J mice subcutaneously or through tail veins. pcDNA3.1 empty vector or LMP1/pcDNA3.1 vaccine was delivered by a helium-driven gene gun. Effectiveness of vaccine was evaluated by measuring the tumor size and numbers of metastatic lung nodules. Circulating cytokines were evaluated by ELISArray. Populations of activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and LMP1-specific T lymphocytes were evaluated by flow cytometry with CD8/CD107a double staining and interferon-γ ELISPOT assay, respectively.RESULTS: LMP1 vaccine significantly suppressed tumor growth (n = 3) and metastasis (n = 4) in vivo. When vaccinated before tumor challenge, all mice in vaccine group were tumor-free, whereas all mice in the control group developed tumors within 2 weeks after tumor challenge (n = 10). Cytokine ELISArray revealed elevation of a panel of proinflammatory cytokines in mice receiving LMP1 vaccine. Flow cytometry and interferon-γ ELISPOT assay revealed that LMP1 vaccine induced larger populations of activated CTLs and LMP1-specific T lymphocytes.CONCLUSIONS: This pre-clinical study provides a promising result that LMP1 vaccine suppresses LMP1-expressing tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.

28056882	Functional significance of CD105-positive cells in papillary renal cell carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: CD105 was postulated as a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) stem cell marker, and CD133 as a putative RCC progenitor. Hypoxia, a natural microenvironment that prevails in tumors, was also incorporated into the study, especially in terms of the promotion of hypothetical stem-like cell properties.METHODS: Within this study, we verify the existence of CD105+ and CD133+ populations in selected papillary subtype RCC (pRCC) cell lines. Both populations were analyzed for correlation with stem-like cell properties, such as stemness gene expression, and sphere and colony formation. For the preliminary analysis, several RCC cell lines were chosen (786-O, SMKT-R2, Caki-2, 796-P, ACHN, RCC6) and the control was human kidney cancer stem cells (HKCSC) and renal cells of embryonic origin (ASE-5063). Four cell lines were chosen for further investigation: Caki-2 (one of the highest numbers of CD105+ cells; primary origin), ACHN (a low number of CD105+ cells; metastatic origin), HKCSC (putative positive control), and ASE-5063 (additional control).RESULTS: In 769-P and RCC6, we could not detect a CD105+ population. Hypoxia variously affects pRCC cell growth, and mainly diminishes the stem-like properties of cells. Furthermore, we could not observe the correlation of CD105 and/or CD133 expression with the enhancement of stem-like properties.CONCLUSIONS: Based on this analysis, CD105/CD133 cannot be validated as cancer stem cell markers of pRCC cell lines.

28056880	Solitary plasmacytoma: population-based analysis of survival trends and effect of various treatment modalities in the USA.	BACKGROUND: Solitary plasmacytoma (SP) is a localized neoplastic plasma cell disorder with an annual incidence of less than 450 cases. Given the rarity of this disorder, it is difficult to conduct large-scale population studies. Consequently, very limited information on the disorder is available, making it difficult to estimate the incidence and survival rates. Furthermore, limited information is available on the efficacy of various treatment modalities in relation to primary tumor sites.METHODS: The data for this retrospective study were drawn from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, which comprises 18 registries; patient demographics, treatment modalities and survival rates were obtained for those diagnosed with SP from 1998 to 2007. Various prognostic factors were analyzed via Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test, with 5-year relative survival rate defined as the primary outcome of interest. Cox regression analysis was employed in the multivariate analysis.RESULTS: The SEER search from 1998 to 2007 yielded records for 1691 SP patients. The median age at diagnosis was 63 years. The patient cohort was 62.4% male, 37.6% female, 80% Caucasian, 14.6% African American and 5.4% other races. Additionally, 57.8% had osseous plasmacytoma, and 31.9% had extraosseous involvement. Unspecified plasmacytoma was noted in 10.2% of patients. The most common treatment modalities were radiotherapy (RT) (48.8%), followed by combination surgery with RT (21.2%) and surgery alone (11.6%). Univariate analysis of prognostic factors revealed that the survival outcomes were better for younger male patients who received RT with surgery (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, patients who received neoadjuvant RT had increased survival rates compared to those receiving adjuvant RT (86% vs 73%, p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the analyses revealed that 5-year survival rates for patients with axial plasmacytoma were superior when RT was combined with surgery (p &lt; 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, age &lt;60 years and treatment with either RT or surgery showed superior survival rates. Progression to multiple myeloma (MM) was noted in 551 patients. Age &gt;60 years was associated with a lower 5-year survival in patients who progressed to MM compared to those who were diagnosed initially with MM (15.1 vs 16.6%). Finally, those who received RT and progressed to MM still had a higher chance of survival than those who were diagnosed with MM initially and treated with RT/surgery (21.8% vs 15.9%, p &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: A review of the pertinent literature indicates that we provided the most comprehensive population-based analysis of SP to date. Moreover, our study contributes to the establishment of the optimal SP treatment modality, as RT is the favored option in frontline settings. Consensus is currently lacking regarding the benefits of combined treatment including surgery. Thus, the findings reported here elucidate the role of primary treatment modalities while also demonstrating the quantifiable benefits of combining RT with surgery in relation to different primary tumor sites. While our results are promising, they should be confirmed through further large-scale randomized studies.	NA	0
28056876	A case report of primary unilateral adrenal NK/T cell lymphoma: good clinical outcome with trimodality treatment.	BACKGROUND: Primary natural killer (NK)/T cell lymphoma of adrenal glands is an extremely rare tumor with aggressive clinical behavior. There have only been a few cases reported worldwide and the highest reported survival was 90 days. We report the first case of primary unilateral adrenal NK/T cell lymphoma in China with good outcome.CASE PRESENTATION: This is a 28-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have a large mass on the left adrenal and the top of the renal region. The patient underwent surgical resection and the pathology revealed primary adrenal NK/T cell lymphoma. He received adjuvant sandwich therapy encompassing sequential chemotherapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The patient remains clinically and symptomatically disease-free with over two years follow up.CONCLUSION: Given the rarity of this disease, there is limited experience with regard to its diagnosis and treatment. This case report will add to the scant literature on this tumor and will be useful for the differential diagnosis and treatment of adrenal disease.	NA	0
28056874	Sorafenib versus sunitinib as first-line treatment agents in Chinese patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma: the largest multicenter retrospective analysis of survival and prognostic factors.	BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy of sorafenib and sunitinib with regard to overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in Chinese patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective study was performed to elucidate the relationship between clinical variables and prognosis comparing sorafenib and sunitinib as first-line treatment agents in Chinese patients with mRCC. Between September 2006 and December 2014, 845 patients received either sorafenib (400 mg bid; n = 483) or sunitinib (50 mg q.d; n = 362). The primary end point was OS and PFS.RESULTS: The percentage of patients with low and moderate risk according to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) score was significantly higher in sunitinib group, and that with high risk was significantly higher in sorafenib group (15.1 vs. 5.2%; p &lt; 0.001). Median OS was similar in sorafenib and sunitinib group (24 vs. 24 months; p = 0.298). Sorafenib group exhibited higher mPFS compared to sunitinib group (11.1 vs. 10.0 months; p = 0.028). Treatment (sorafenib vs sunitinib), pathology, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, MSKCC scores, Heng's criteria of risk, and number of metastases were identified as significant predictors for OS and along with liver metastasis for PFS. Clinical outcomes in terms of mOS was significantly better with sorafenib in patients ≥65 years of age (p = .041), ECOG 0 (p = 0.0001), and median MSKCC risk score (p = 0.008).CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib and sunitinib are both effective in treating mRCC. However, sorafenib might be more effective in elderly patients (≥65 years) and in patients with an ECOG status of 0, classified under MSKCC moderate risk.	NA	0
28056871	Lung adenocarcinoma expressing receptor for advanced glycation end-products with primary systemic AL amyloidosis: a case report and literature review.	BACKGROUND: Receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), a receptor for amyloids, is constitutively expressed in lungs and generally observed to be downregulated in lung cancer tissues. However, increasing levels of RAGE or serum amyloids is associated with poor outcome in lung cancer patients. We report a rare case of primary systemic amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis in biopsy-proven multiple organs with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that displayed strong staining for RAGE in the tumour tissue. Interestingly, compared with randomly selected lung cancer biopsy samples, including all representative histological subtypes of NSCLC and small-cell lung cancer, only the NSCLC in the present case showed strong expression for RAGE that can bind amyloids.CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for comprehensive investigation of nephrotic syndrome. Computed tomography showed a small nodule in the right upper lung lobe with hilar mediastinal lymph node enlargement. Pathological examination of transbronchial biopsy samples of the nodule yielded a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, the pathological detection of amyloid deposition in biopsy samples of a subcarinal lymph node, gastric and duodenal mucosa, cardiac muscle, and bone marrow led to a diagnosis of primary systemic AL amyloidosis with nephrotic syndrome and cardiomyopathy. In addition, RAGE was detected in lung tumour tissues surrounded by normal lung tissues with amyloid deposition.CONCLUSION: The RAGE positivity of the lung cancer cells in this case suggests an interaction between amyloid-containing tissues and RAGE-expressing cancer cells. Lung adenocarcinoma with RAGE expression may be a complication of underlying amyloidosis.	NA	0
28056869	Protein kinase C inhibitor Gö6976 but not Gö6983 induces the reversion of E- to N-cadherin switch and metastatic phenotype in melanoma: identification of the role of protein kinase D1.	BACKGROUND: Melanoma is a highly metastatic type of cancer that is resistant to all standard anticancer therapies and thus has a poor prognosis. Therefore, metastatic melanoma represents a significant clinical problem and requires novel and effective targeted therapies. The protein kinase C (PKC) family comprises multiple isoforms of serine/threonine kinases that possess distinct roles in cancer development and progression. In this study, we determined whether inhibition of PKC could revert a major process required for melanoma progression and metastasis; i.e. the E- to N-cadherin switch.METHODS: The cadherin switch was analyzed in different patient-derived primary tumors and their respective metastatic melanoma cells to determine the appropriate cellular model (aggressive E-cadherin-negative/N-cadherin-positive metastasis-derived melanoma cells). Next, PKC inhibition in two selected metastatic melanoma cell lines, was performed by using either pharmacological inhibitors (Gö6976 and Gö6983) or stable lentiviral shRNA transduction. The expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin was determined by western blot. The consequences of cadherin switch reversion were analyzed: cell morphology, intercellular interactions, and β-catenin subcellular localization were analyzed by immunofluorescence labeling and confocal microscopy; cyclin D1 expression was analyzed by western blot; cell metastatic potential was determined by anchorage-independent growth assay using methylcellulose as semi-solid medium and cell migration potential by wound healing and transwell assays.RESULTS: Gö6976 but not Gö6983 reversed the E- to N-cadherin switch and as a consequence induced intercellular interactions, profound morphological changes from elongated mesenchymal-like to cuboidal epithelial-like shape, β-catenin translocation from the nucleus to the plasma membrane inhibiting its oncogenic function, and reverting the metastatic potential of the aggressive melanoma cells. Comparison of the target spectrum of these inhibitors indicated that these observations were not the consequence of the inhibition of conventional PKCs (cPKCs), but allowed the identification of a novel serine/threonine kinase, i.e. protein kinase Cμ, also known as protein kinase D1 (PKD1), whose specific inhibition allows the reversion of the metastatic phenotype in aggressive melanoma.CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study suggests, for the first time, that while cPKCs don't embody a pertinent therapeutic target, inhibition of PKD1 represents a novel attractive approach for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

28056866	Case report: whole exome sequencing of primary cardiac angiosarcoma highlights potential for targeted therapies.	BACKGROUND: Primary cardiac angiosarcomas are rare, but they are the most aggressive type of primary cardiac neoplasms. When patients do present, it is with advanced pulmonary and/or cardiac symptoms. Therefore, many times the correct diagnosis is not made at the time of initial presentation. These patients have metastatic disease and the vast majority of these patients die within a few months after diagnosis. Currently the treatment choices are limited and there are no targeted therapies available.CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old male presented with shortness of breath, night sweats, and productive cough for a month. Workup revealed pericardial effusion and multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules suspicious for metastatic disease. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a large pericardial effusion and a large mass in the base of the right atrium. Results of biopsy of bilateral lung nodules established a diagnosis of primary cardiac angiosarcoma. Aggressive pulmonary disease caused rapid deterioration; the patient went on hospice and subsequently died. Whole exome sequencing of the patient's postmortem tumor revealed a novel KDR (G681R) mutation, and focal high-level amplification at chromosome 1q encompassing MDM4, a negative regulator of TP53.CONCLUSION: Mutations in KDR have been reported previously in angiosarcomas. Previous studies also demonstrated that KDR mutants with constitutive KDR activation could be inhibited with specific KDR inhibitors in vitro. Thus, patients harboring activating KDR mutations could be candidates for treatment with KDR-specific inhibitors.	association	1
28056863	Growth, progression and chromosome instability of Neuroblastoma: a new scenario of tumorigenesis?	BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer with a low survival rate of patients with metastatic stage 4 disease. Tumor aggressiveness and progression have been associated with structural copy number variations (CNVs) that are observed in malignant cells. In contrast, localized Neuroblastomas, which are associated with a low number of structural CNVs but frequent numerical CNVs, are less aggressive, and patients have good outcomes. Finally, whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing of Neuroblastoma tissues have shown few damaging mutations in these tumors.CONCLUSIONS: In the present report it is proposed that chromosome instability (CIN) plays a major role in Neuroblastoma tumorigenesis and that CIN is already present in the early phases of tumor development. High CIN can promote several types of chromosomal damage including chromothripsis, gene deletion, amplification and rearrangements, which deregulate gene expression. Indeed, gene rearrangements have been reported as a new scenario in the development of Neuroblastoma, which supports the hypothesis that CIN is an early step preliminary to the late catastrophic events leading to tumor development.

28056862	Association between telomere length and the risk of colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis of observational studies.	BACKGROUND: Human chromosomes are capped and stabilized by telomeres. Telomere length regulates a 'cellular mitotic clock' that defines the number of cell divisions and hence, cellular life span. This study aimed to synthesize the evidence on the association between peripheral blood leucocytes (PBL) telomere length and the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).METHODS: We searched relevant studies in electronic databases. When two or more observational studies reported the same outcome measures, we performed pooled analysis. All the analyses were performed on PBL using PCR. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the strength of association.RESULTS: Seven studies (with 8 datasets) were included in this meta-analysis; 3 prospective studies, 3 retrospective studies and 1 study with a separate prospective and retrospective designs. The pooled analysis of 4 prospective studies (summary OR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.77-1.34, I (2):30%) and 4 retrospective studies (summary OR 1.65, 95% CI: 0.96-2.83, I (2):96%) showed no relationship between PBL telomere length and the CRC risk. A subgroup analysis of 2 prospective studies exclusively on females also showed no association between PBL telomere length and the CRC risk (summary OR, 1.17, 95% CI:0.72-1.91, I (2):57%).CONCLUSION: The current analysis is insufficient to provide evidence on the relationship between PBL telomere length and the risk of CRC. Findings suggest that there may be a complex relationship between PBL telomere length and the CRC risk or discrepancy between genetics, age of patients and clinical studies. Future well powered, large prospective studies on the relationship between telomere length and the risk of CRC, and the investigations of the biologic mechanisms are recommended.	NA	0
28056859	Molecular chess? Hallmarks of anti-cancer drug resistance.	BACKGROUND: The development of resistance is a problem shared by both classical chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Patients may respond well at first, but relapse is inevitable for many cancer patients, despite many improvements in drugs and their use over the last 40 years.REVIEW: Resistance to anti-cancer drugs can be acquired by several mechanisms within neoplastic cells, defined as (1) alteration of drug targets, (2) expression of drug pumps, (3) expression of detoxification mechanisms, (4) reduced susceptibility to apoptosis, (5) increased ability to repair DNA damage, and (6) altered proliferation. It is clear, however, that changes in stroma and tumour microenvironment, and local immunity can also contribute to the development of resistance. Cancer cells can and do use several of these mechanisms at one time, and there is considerable heterogeneity between tumours, necessitating an individualised approach to cancer treatment. As tumours are heterogeneous, positive selection of a drug-resistant population could help drive resistance, although acquired resistance cannot simply be viewed as overgrowth of a resistant cancer cell population. The development of such resistance mechanisms can be predicted from pre-existing genomic and proteomic profiles, and there are increasingly sophisticated methods to measure and then tackle these mechanisms in patients.CONCLUSION: The oncologist is now required to be at least one step ahead of the cancer, a process that can be likened to 'molecular chess'. Thus, as well as an increasing role for predictive biomarkers to clinically stratify patients, it is becoming clear that personalised strategies are required to obtain best results.	NA	2
28056857	Upregulation of Mrps18a in breast cancer identified by selecting phage antibody libraries on breast tissue sections.	BACKGROUND: One of the hallmarks of cancer is an altered energy metabolism, and here, mitochondria play a central role. Previous studies have indicated that some mitochondrial ribosomal proteins change their expression patterns upon transformation.METHOD: In this study, we have used the selection of recombinant antibody libraries displayed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage as a proteomics discovery tool for the identification of breast cancer biomarkers. A small subpopulation of breast cells expressing both cytokeratin 19 and cytokeratin 14 was targeted using a novel selection procedure.RESULTS: We identified the mitochondrial ribosomal protein s18a (Mrps18a) as a protein which is upregulated in breast cancer. However, Mrps18a was not homogeneously upregulated in all cancer cells, suggesting the existence of sub-populations within the tumor. The upregulation was not confined to cytokeratin 19 and cytokeratin 14 double positive cells.CONCLUSION: This study illustrates how phage display can be applied towards the discovery of proteins which exhibit changes in their expression patterns. We identified the mitochondrial protein Mrps18a as being upregulated in human breast cancer cells compared to normal breast cells.	NA	0
28056854	Establishing a xenograft mouse model of peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer with organ invasion and fibrosis.	BACKGROUND: The clinical prognosis of gastric cancer with peritoneal dissemination is poor because of its chemoresistance and rich fibrosis. While several gastric cancer cell lines have been used to establish models of peritoneal dissemination by intraperitoneal injection, most peritoneal tumors that form adopt a medullary pattern in microscopic appearance. This histological finding for the model differs from that in the clinical situation. This study was performed to demonstrate the contribution of human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) to fibrotic tumor formation and to establish a new xenograft model with high potential for peritoneal dissemination with organ invasion and extensive fibrosis.METHODS: We established four types of xenograft model: i) intraperitoneal injection of MKN45-P cells alone (control group), ii) injection of MKN45-P cells co-cultured with HPMCs (co-cultured group), iii) scratching the parietal peritoneum (parietal group), and iv) scratching the visceral peritoneum (visceral group) with a cotton swab before injection of co-cultured cells. Fibrosis, α-smooth muscle actin expression, and organ invasion by tumor cells were all assessed by immunohistochemical examination.RESULTS: All mice developed abdominal swelling with peritoneal tumors and bloody ascites. Tumors of the control and co-cultured groups were not invasive or fibrotic. Contrastingly, tumors of the scratch groups exhibited rich stromal fibrosis and possessed increased α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression. In particular, the visceral group showed edematous and spreading tumors invading the intestinal wall.CONCLUSION: We established a model of peritoneal dissemination with organ invasion and stromal fibrosis. Formation of peritoneal dissemination required a favorable environment for cell adhesion, invasion, and growth.

Some cancers evade targeted therapies through a mechanism known as lineage plasticity, whereby tumor cells acquire phenotypic characteristics of a cell lineage whose survival no longer depends on the drug target. We use in vitro and in vivo human prostate cancer models to show that these tumors can develop resistance to the antiandrogen drug enzalutamide by a phenotypic shift from androgen receptor (AR)-dependent luminal epithelial cells to AR-independent basal-like cells. This lineage plasticity is enabled by the loss of TP53 and RB1 function, is mediated by increased expression of the reprogramming transcription factor SOX2, and can be reversed by restoring TP53 and RB1 function or by inhibiting SOX2 expression. Thus, mutations in tumor suppressor genes can create a state of increased cellular plasticity that, when challenged with antiandrogen therapy, promotes resistance through lineage switching.	therapeutic	1
28059767	Rb1 and Trp53 cooperate to suppress prostate cancer lineage plasticity, metastasis, and antiandrogen resistance.	Prostate cancer relapsing from antiandrogen therapies can exhibit variant histology with altered lineage marker expression, suggesting that lineage plasticity facilitates therapeutic resistance. The mechanisms underlying prostate cancer lineage plasticity are incompletely understood. Studying mouse models, we demonstrate that Rb1 loss facilitates lineage plasticity and metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma initiated by Pten mutation. Additional loss of Trp53 causes resistance to antiandrogen therapy. Gene expression profiling indicates that mouse tumors resemble human prostate cancer neuroendocrine variants; both mouse and human tumors exhibit increased expression of epigenetic reprogramming factors such as Ezh2 and Sox2. Clinically relevant Ezh2 inhibitors restore androgen receptor expression and sensitivity to antiandrogen therapy. These findings uncover genetic mutations that enable prostate cancer progression; identify mouse models for studying prostate cancer lineage plasticity; and suggest an epigenetic approach for extending clinical responses to antiandrogen therapy.	therapeutic	1

28057355	Physical activity and breast cancer risk by pathological subtype.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of physical activity on breast cancer risk and evaluate whether adherence to international recommendations is associated with a decreased risk.METHODS: This is a multicenter matched case-control study where 698 pairs completed a physical activity questionnaire. Recreational physical activity during the last year was quantified in metabolic equivalent hours per week (MET-h/week) and categorized in activities of moderate (3.0-5.9 MET) and vigorous (&gt;6 MET) intensity. The adherence to World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research recommendation was also assessed. The association with breast cancer risk, overall and by pathologic subtype, was evaluated using conditional and multinomial logistic regression models.RESULTS: Mean MET-h/week was 16.6 among cases and 20.4 among controls. Premenopausal breast cancer risk decreased by 5% (P=0.007) for every 6 MET-h/week increase in energy expenditure. By contrast, postmenopausal women needed to do more intense exercise to observe benefits. The protection was more pronounced for nulliparous women, as well as for hormone receptor positive and HER2+ tumors. Physically inactive women displayed a 71% increased risk when compared with those who met the international recommendation (P=0.001). Finally, women who were inactive during the previous year, regardless of the overall physical activity reported in previous periods, showed an increased risk when compared to always active women.CONCLUSIONS: Women who report adherence to international physical activity recommendations entail a significant decrease in risk for all pathologic breast cancer subtypes. This is of particular interest in Spain, where a significant increase in overweight and obesity in recent decades is observed.	NA	0
28057354	Neuroendrocrine tumors of the uterine cervix: A therapeutic challenge for gynecologic oncologists.	Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are aggressive diseases developing from neuroendocrine cells that most frequently involve the gastro-entero-pancreatic tract and the lung, but more rarely are found in almost all body tissues. Limited biological and clinical data are currently available for NETs in uncommon sites, such as female genital tract. NETs represent 0.9% to 1.5% of the tumors of the uterine cervix. They are more likely to have lymph-vascular space invasion and lymph node involvement, and to develop local and distant relapses when compared with the mostly common cervical squamous cell carcinomas or adenocarcinomas. Positive immunostaining for synaptophysin, chromogranin, CD56, and neuron-specific enolase is often detected in cervical NETs . The most recent editions of the World Health Organization Classification of Gynecologic Tract tumors grouped cervical carcinoid tumor and atypical carcinoid tumor into low-grade NETs and cervical small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma into high-grade NETs. High-risk HPV DNA is detected in almost all cervical high-grade NETs. No treatment guidelines, based on prospective, well-designed clinical trials, are currently available due to the rarity of these tumors. Many authors have reported different multimodality approaches, mainly derived from NETs of the lung. These usually consist in radical hysterectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or concurrent chemoradiation for early stage disease, definitive concurrent chemoradiation sometimes preceded by neoadjuvant chemotherapy and followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced disease, and palliative chemotherapy for metastatic disease. In this systematic review, we address the histologic classification of cervical NETs, analyze their pathogenesis and overall prognosis, and evaluate the different treatment modalities described in the literature, in order to offer a possible algorithm that may help the clinicians in diagnosing and treating patients with these uncommon and aggressive malignancies.

28061006	Confirmation of ProMisE: A simple, genomics-based clinical classifier for endometrial cancer.	BACKGROUND: Classification of endometrial carcinomas (ECs) by morphologic features is irreproducible and imperfectly reflects tumor biology. The authors developed the Proactive Molecular Risk Classifier for Endometrial Cancer (ProMisE), a molecular classification system based on The Cancer Genome Atlas genomic subgroups, and sought to confirm both feasibility and prognostic ability in a new, large cohort of ECs.METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the presence or absence of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins (to identify MMR deficiency [MMR-D]), sequencing for polymerase-ɛ (POLE) exonuclease domain mutations (POLE EDMs), and IHC for tumor protein 53 (p53) (wild type vs null/missense mutations; p53 wt and p53 abn, respectively) were performed on 319 new EC samples. Subgroups were characterized and assessed relative to outcomes. The prognostic ability of ProMisE was compared with that of current risk-stratification systems (European Society of Medical Oncology [ESMO]).RESULTS: ProMisE decision-tree classification achieved categorization of all cases and identified 4 prognostic subgroups with distinct overall, disease-specific, and progression-free survival (P &lt; .001). Tumors with POLE EDMs had the most favorable prognosis, and those with p53 abn the worst prognosis, and separation of the 2 middle survival curves (p53 wt and MMR-D) was observed. There were no significant differences in survival between the ESMO low-risk and intermediate-risk groups. ProMisE improved the ability to discriminate outcomes compared with ESMO risk stratification. There was substantial overlap (89%) between the p53 abn and high-risk ESMO subgroups; but, otherwise, there were no predictable associations between molecular and ESMO risk groups.CONCLUSIONS: Molecular classification of ECs can be achieved using clinically applicable methods and provides independent prognostic information beyond established clinicopathologic risk factors available at diagnosis. Consistent, biologically relevant categorization enables stratification for clinical trials and/or targeted therapy, identification of women who are at increased risk of having Lynch syndrome, and may guide clinical management.

28061004	Objective physical and mental markers of self-reported fatigue in women undergoing (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Objective, treatment-independent markers of cancer-related fatigue are needed to advance clinical trials. In the current study, the authors evaluated physical, neurocognitive, and serologic markers for correlation with self-reported fatigue before and after (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with early-stage breast cancer.METHODS: Women with AJCC TNM Stage I-III breast cancer consented to assessment before and after the completion of 4 cycles of dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Assessment included self-reported fatigue (using the Brief Fatigue Inventory), depression (using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale [CES-D]), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and 28 objective measures (grip strength in dominant and nondominant hands, 6-minute walk, daily total energy expenditure, 14 neurocognitive tests, and 10 serologic markers). Generalized linear regression models of fatigue were constructed (1 model per marker), and adjusted for depression, timing before/after chemotherapy, menopausal status, obesity, and educational level. P values were adjusted to control the False Discovery Rate.RESULTS: Of 28 subjects, 3 withdrew without completing baseline assessments. Prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy data were available for the evaluation of physical measures (25 subjects aged 50.6 ± 9.5 years), neurocognitive tests (22 subjects), and serologic markers (10 subjects). On covariate-adjusted analysis, interleukin (IL)-12 was found to be associated with fatigue at both assessments (P&lt;.01). Serum eotaxin (P &lt; .01), IL-1RA (P &lt; .01), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) (P&lt;.01), and performance on 2 neurocognitive (Trail Making) tests (P&lt;.01 and P = .02, respectively) were found to be inversely associated with fatigue before chemotherapy but not afterward, whereas daily energy expenditure, serum MCP-1, and serum macrophage inflammatory protein 1a (MIP-1a) were found to be associated with fatigue after receipt of chemotherapy but not before (P&lt;.01 for each). The association between energy expenditure and fatigue was detectable only if an actively athletic subject with outlier values of energy expenditure was excluded.CONCLUSIONS: Serum IL-12 merits confirmatory testing as an objective, treatment-independent measure of fatigue in patients with early-stage breast cancer.

28060456	Significance of high-risk HPV detection in women with atypical glandular cells on Pap testing: Analysis of 1857 cases from an academic institution.	BACKGROUND: The role of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing in women with various types of atypical glandular cells (AGC) on Papanicolaou (Pap) test is undetermined.METHODS: Herein, the authors retrospectively searched their pathology database for cases of AGC with concurrent hrHPV testing and histological follow-up results within 1 year between January 2008 and December 2013.RESULTS: Among 3709 AGC cases occurring during the study period, 2287 had concurrent Hybrid Capture 2 HPV testing results. The overall rate of hrHPV positivity (hrHPV+) was 27.7%. Of these 2287 cases, 1857 cases (81.2%) had histological follow-up results within 1 year, including 529 hrHPV + cases and 1328 hrHPV-negative (hrHPV-) cases. Among the hrHPV + cases, 16.8% had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 (CIN2/3), 5.7% had cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS)/adenocarcinoma (ADC), and 1.1% had an endometrial carcinoma. Among the hrHPV- cases, 0.6% had CIN2/3, 0.2% had AIS/ADC, and 3.8% had an endometrial carcinoma. The rate of high-grade cervical lesions (CIN2/3, AIS, or ADC) was significantly higher in women who were hrHPV + compared with hrHPV- women for all age groups. Endometrial carcinoma was most commonly present in women aged ≥50 years.CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the largest follow-up study published to date regarding women with AGC cytology and HPV testing. The study data indicate that hrHPV testing is useful for predicting the risk of high-grade cervical neoplasia in women with AGC, but has no significant value in evaluating the risk of endometrial carcinoma. The combination of cytology, hrHPV testing, and patient age can significantly aid in the appropriate management of these individuals. Cancer Cytopathol 2016. © 2016 American Cancer Society.	NA	0
28056913	Prognostic relevance of lactate dehydrogenase in advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients.	BACKGROUND: The prognostic role of pretreatment serum lactate dehydronegase (LDH) has been well established in many malignant tumors, albeit it remains under-discussed in pancreatic cancer. In the present study, we aimed to assess the association between baseline LDH levels and overall survival (OS) in advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients who did and did not receive subsequent chemotherapy.METHODS: In total, 135 retrospectively determined patients with locally advanced or metastatic PDAC, who were diagnosed between 2012 and 2013, were analyzed. Baseline LDH levels were detected within 20 days after histopathological confirmation of the diagnosis. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was applied to estimate the adjusted hazards ratio (HR) for LDH levels and OS of PDAC. We used restricted cubic spline (RCS) to further investigate dose-effect relationship in the association.RESULTS: Having adjusted for possible confounders, we found that in advanced PDAC patients who went through subsequent chemotherapy, an elevated pretreatment LDH level (≥250 U/L) had an adjusted HR of 2.47 (95% CI = 1.28-4.77) for death, but patients, who did not receive chemotherapy, had no significant HR (adjusted HR = 1.57; 95% CI = 0.83-2.96). RCS fitting results revealed a steep increase in HR for PDAC patients received chemotherapy with a baseline LDH &gt; 500 U/L.CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment LDH levels had noticeable prognostic value in PDAC patients who received subsequent chemotherapy. Tackling elevated LDH levels before the initiation of chemotherapy might be a promising measure for improving OS of patients after treatment for their advanced PDAC. Studies with a large sample size and a prospective design are warranted to substantiate our findings.	NA	2

28056901	Expansion of the Milan criteria without any sacrifice: combination of the Hangzhou criteria with the pre-transplant platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio.	BACKGROUND: The Hangzhou criteria expand the Milan criteria safely and effectively in selecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) candidates for liver transplantation (LT), but some patients exceeding the Milan but fulfilling the Hangzhou criteria still show poor outcomes due to early tumor recurrence. In this study, the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) was employed to differentiate high-risk tumor recurrence recipients, and a new method combining PLR and the Hangzhou criteria was established.METHODS: The clinical data of 343 LT for HCC were retrospectively analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the PLR cut-off value to stratify patients exceeding the Milan but fulfilling the Hangzhou criteria. The recurrence-free survival (RFS) of recipients was compared after stratification. The Hangzhou criteria &amp; PLR method was proposed and its feasibility was validated by ROC analysis.RESULTS: PLR 120 was the most significant cut-off value when comparing RFS of patients exceeding the Milan but fulfilling the Hangzhou criteria. After stratification, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS of patients exceeding the Milan but fulfilling the Hangzhou criteria with PLR &lt; 120 were 84.2%, 73.3%, and 73.3%, respectively, comparable with 85.7%, 73.9%, and 72.8%, respectively, in patients fulfilling the Milan criteria (P = 0.885). Patients exceeding the Milan but fulfilling the Hangzhou criteria with PLR ≥ 120 showed poor outcomes, which were similar in patients exceeding the Hangzhou criteria; 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS were only 37.5%, 12.5%, and 12.5% vs. 32.3%, 17.6%, and 15.1%, respectively (P = 0.887). ROC analysis demonstrated that the ROC area of the Hangzhou criteria &amp; PLR method was 0.768 for RFS. Multivariate analysis confirmed that PLR ≥ 120 was independently associated with RFS of patients exceeding the Milan but fulfilling the Hangzhou criteria.CONCLUSIONS: The Hangzhou criteria combined with the pre-transplant PLR can accurately exclude high-risk tumor recurrence recipients; this approach expands the Milan criteria effectively without any sacrifice.

28056899	PGE2 promotes breast cancer-associated lymphangiogenesis by activation of EP4 receptor on lymphatic endothelial cells.	BACKGROUND: Lymphatic metastasis, facilitated by lymphangiogenesis is a common occurrence in breast cancer, the molecular mechanisms remaining incompletely understood. We had earlier shown that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression by human or murine breast cancer cells promoted lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis by upregulating VEGF-C/D production by tumor cells or tumor-associated macrophages primarily due to activation of the prostaglandin receptor EP4 by endogenous PGE2. It is not clear whether tumor or host-derived PGE2 has any direct effect on lymphangiogenesis, and if so, whether EP4 receptors on lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) play any role.METHODS: Here, we address these questions employing in vitro studies with a COX-2-expressing and VEGF-C/D-producing murine breast cancer cell line C3L5 and a rat mesenteric (RM) LEC line and in vivo studies in nude mice.RESULTS: RMLEC responded to PGE2, an EP4 agonist PGE1OH, or C3L5 cell-conditioned media (C3L5-CM) by increased proliferation, migration and accelerated tube formation on growth factor reduced Matrigel. Native tube formation by RMLEC on Matrigel was abrogated in the presence of a selective COX-2 inhibitor or an EP4 antagonist. Addition of PGE2 or EP4 agonist, or C3L5-CM individually in the presence of COX-2 inhibitor, or EP4 antagonist, restored tube formation, reinforcing the role of EP4 on RMLEC in tubulogenesis. These results were partially duplicated with a human dermal LEC (HMVEC-dLyAd) and a COX-2 expressing human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Knocking down EP4 with shRNA in RMLEC abrogated their tube forming capacity on Matrigel in the absence or presence of PGE2, EP4 agonist, or C3L5-CM. RMLEC tubulogenesis following EP4 activation by agonist treatment was dependent on PI3K/Akt and Erk signaling pathways and VEGFR-3 stimulation. Finally in a directed in vivo lymphangiogenesis assay (DIVLA) we demonstrated the lymphangiogenic as well as angiogenic capacity of PGE2 and EP4 agonist in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the roles of tumor as well as host-derived PGE2 in inducing lymphangiogenesis, at least in part, by activating EP4 and VEGFR-3 on LEC. EP4 being a common target on both tumor and host cells contributing to tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis reaffirms the therapeutic value of EP4 antagonists in the intervention of lymphatic metastasis in breast cancer.

28058631	Induction of apoptosis of liver cancer cells by nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs).	The application of nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) is a novel method to induce the death of cancer cells. NsPEFs could directly function on the cell membrane and activate the apoptosis pathways, then induce apoptosis in various cell lines. However, the nsPEFs-inducing-apoptosis action sites and the exact pathways are not clear now. In this study, nsPEFs were applied to the human liver cancer cells HepG2 with different parameters. By apoptosis assay, morphological observation, detecting the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ m), intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) and the expressions of key apoptosis factors, we demonstrated that nsPEFs could induce the morphology of cell apoptosis, the change in ΔΨ m, [Ca(2+)]i and the upregulation of some key apoptosis factors, which revealed the responses of liver cancer cells and indicated that cells may undergo apoptosis through the mitochondria-dependent pathway after nsPEFs were applied.

28058630	IL-33 acts as a foe to MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer.	IL-33 is a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines, and no study has been performed to address its direct anti-tumor effect. This study is designed to investigate whether IL-33 has any direct effect on pancreatic cancer. Clonogenic survival assay, immunohistochemistry, TUNEL staining, proliferation, caspase-3 activity kits and RT-PCR were used to evaluate the effects of IL-33 on cell survival, proliferation and apoptosis of a pancreatic cancer cell line, MIA PaCa-2. We found that the percentage of colonies of MIA PaCa-2 cells, PCNA+ cells and the OD value of cancer cells were all decreased in the presence of IL-33. TUNEL+ cells and the relative caspase-3 activity in cancer cells were increased in the presence of IL-33. We further found that its anti-proliferative effect on cancer cells correlated with downregulation of pro-proliferative molecules cdk2 and cdk4 and upregulation of anti-proliferative molecules p15, p21 and p53. Its pro-apoptotic effect correlated with downregulation of anti-apoptotic molecule FLIP and upregulation of pro-apoptotic molecule TRAIL. These results suggest that IL-33 presents significant anti-tumor effects by inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis of MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells. Thus, strength of IL-33/ST2 signal pathway might be a promising way to treat pancreatic cancer.	NA	0
28058629	RNAi-mediated knockdown of MCM7 gene on CML cells and its therapeutic potential for leukemia.	MCM7 is one of the subunits of MCM2-7 complex, which is essential to DNA replication licensing and the control of cell cycle progression. It has been demonstrated that MCM7 participates in mRNA transcription and DNA damage regulation as well. MCM7 gene is found to be over-expressed in multiple cancers, but there are few reports about its effect in leukemia. Recent studies have proven that MCM7 expression has a relationship with diagnosis and prognosis, which has led to their potential clinical application as a marker for cancer screening. RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process in which RNA molecules inhibit gene expression, typically by causing the destruction of specific mRNA molecules. It is a valuable research tool, which is widely used in cell culture and living organisms as well as in medicine recent years. It is indicated that RNAi application for targeting functional carcinogenic molecules, tumor resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is required in cancer treatment. Gene products knockdown by RNAi technology exerts anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects upon cell culture systems, animal models and in clinical trials in the most studies. In the present study, we found that MCM7 highly expressed in K562 cells rather than that in normal neutrophils. Thus, lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting MCM7 was used to suppress its endogenous expression in K562 cells and develop a novel therapeutic strategy for leukemia.	NA	2
28058628	A pilot study on plasma levels of micro-RNAs involved in angiogenesis and vascular maturation in patients with breast cancer.	Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have a complex role in carcinogenesis and tumour progression. Several miRNAs, such as miR-221, miR-27b and miR-132, have been implicated in the regulation of VEGF tumour angiogenic activity. In this pilot study, we assessed angiogenesis and DLL4+ vascular maturation index (VMI) in breast cancer tissues, in parallel with the plasma levels of the above-mentioned miRNAs. Significantly higher than control samples pre-operative levels were recorded in 10/11, 7/11 and 9/11 cases for the miR-221, miR-27b and miR-132, respectively. Seven days after surgery, a significant reduction of these miRNAs was noted in 6/11, 3/11 and 2/11 cases, respectively. High pre-operative levels of miR-27b were linked with node metastasis (p = 0.04). High pre-operative levels of miR-132 were linked with small tumours (p = 0.03) and her2 overexpression (p = 0.003). The DLL4+ VMI ranged from 26 to 69% (median 45%). Patients with poor DLL4+ VMI had significantly high pre-operative and post-operative levels of miR-221 (p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively) and high post-operative levels of miR-132 (p = 0.02). It is concluded that angiogenesis-related miRs as detected in the plasma of patients may prove of a useful tool in the identification of patients with poor vascular maturation and high risk to develop metastasis. Whether such miRs may identify patients who would benefit from vascular normalization policies is a hypothesis that emerges from the current study.	NA	0
28058627	A surface tension magnetophoretic device for rare cell isolation and characterization.	The cancer community continues to search for an efficient and cost-effective technique to isolate and characterize circulating cells (CTCs) as a 'real-time liquid biopsy'. Existing methods to isolate and analyze CTCs require various transfer, wash, and staining steps that can be time consuming, expensive, and led to the loss of rare cells. To overcome the limitations of existing CTC isolation strategies, we have developed an inexpensive 'lab on a chip' device for the enrichment, staining, and analysis of rare cell populations. This device utilizes immunomagnetic positive selection of antibody-bound cells, isolation of cells through an immiscible interface, and filtration. The isolated cells can then be stained utilizing immunofluorescence or used for other downstream detection methods. We describe the construction and initial preclinical testing of the device. Initial tests suggest that the device may be well suited for the isolation of CTCs and could allow the monitoring of cancer progression and the response to therapy over time.	NA	0
28058579	Prognostic significance of S100A4-expression and subcellular localization in early-stage breast cancer.	PURPOSE: Prognostic factors are useful in order to identify early-stage breast cancer patients who might benefit from adjuvant treatment. The metastasis-promoting protein S100A4 has previously been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. The protein is expressed in diverse subcellular compartments, including the cytoplasm, extracellular space, and nucleus. Nuclear expression is an independent predictor of poor outcome in several cancer types, but the significance of subcellular expression has not yet been assessed in breast cancer.METHODS: Nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of S100A4 was assessed by immunohistochemistry in prospectively collected tumor samples from early-stage breast cancer patients using tissue microarrays.RESULTS: In patients not receiving adjuvant systemic therapy, nuclear or cytoplasmic expression was found in 44/291 tumors (15%). Expression of either nuclear or cytoplasmic S100A4 was associated with histological grade III, triple-negative subtype, and Ki-67-expression. Patients with S100A4-positive tumors had inferior metastasis-free and overall survival compared to S100A4-negative. When expression was analyzed separately, nuclear S100A4 was a significant predictor of outcome, while cytoplasmic was not. In patients who received adjuvant treatment 23/300 tumors (8%) were S100A4-positive, but no tumors displayed nuclear staining alone. S100A4-expression was strongly associated with histological grade III and triple-negative subtype. Although not significant, metastasis-free and overall survival was numerically reduced in patients with S100A4-positive tumors.CONCLUSION: S100A4-expression was associated with poor outcome in early-stage breast cancer, but the low percentage of positive tumors and the modest survival differences imply that the clinical utility in selection of patients for adjuvant treatment is limited.

28058578	PD-L1 expression and tumor infiltrating PD-1+ lymphocytes associated with outcome in HER2+ breast cancer patients.	PURPOSE: Clinical trials showing programmed death (PD)-1-PD-ligand 1 (L1) axis as a promising therapeutic target in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancers have made the pathway a focus of recent attention. However, the data regarding PD-L1/PD-1 in breast cancer are inconsistent. Given the heterogeneity of breast cancers, the clinical relevance of PD-L1 and PD-1 tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) may vary according to subtypes of breast cancer. We aim to investigate PD-L1 expression in a large cohort of breast cancers and analyze its clinico-pathological as well as outcome relationship according to molecular subtypes. Also, we evaluate the relationship of PD-1 TIL and PD-L1 expression with patients' survival, particularly for breast cancers with high TIL.METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 on tissue arrays for 1091 breast cancer patients and PD-1 TIL on 97 whole sections was performed. Associations of PD-L1 with luminal cancers (p &lt; 0.001) and features associated with that subtype [lower histologic grade, absence of necrosis, ER, PR, and AR expression (p &lt; 0.001)] were observed. However, in HER2+ breast cancers, PD-L1 was an independent poor prognostic indicator (DFS: HR = 1.866, p = 0.001; OS: HR = 1.517, p = 0.036). Interestingly, HER2+ cancers showed a lower PD-1 TIL level compared to the other high TIL cases (p = 0.011). Cases with low PD-TIL but high PD-L1 expression showed the worst survival. This could be indicative of an active immune suppression by PD-L1 expression.CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed the relevance of PD-L1 expression in HER2+ breast cancer. A combined evaluation of PD-L1 and PD-1 TIL in the prognosis of breast cancer might also be of value in treatment prediction.	NA	2
28058445	Safety and pharmacokinetics of cabazitaxel in patients with hepatic impairment: a phase I dose-escalation study.	PURPOSE: Cabazitaxel has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment (HI). This phase I study assessed cabazitaxel safety and pharmacokinetics in patients with HI.METHODS: Patients with advanced, non-hematologic cancer, and normal hepatic function (Cohort 1: C-1), or mild (C-2), moderate (C-3), severe (C-4) HI received cabazitaxel starting doses of 25, 20, 10, and 10 mg/m(2), respectively. Doses were escalated in patients with HI based on Cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Adverse events and the cabazitaxel pharmacokinetic profile were assessed.RESULTS: In C-2, three patients receiving cabazitaxel 25 mg/m(2) experienced DLTs; maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 20 mg/m(2). In C-3, two patients receiving 20 mg/m(2) experienced DLTs; MTD was 15 mg/m(2). C-4 was discontinued early due to DLTs. The most frequent cabazitaxel-related, grade 3-4 toxicity was neutropenia (42%). Cabazitaxel clearance normalized to body surface area (CL/BSA) was lower in C-1 (geometric mean [GM] 13.4 L/h/m(2)) than expected (26.4 L/h/m(2)), but similar in C-2 (23.5 L/h/m(2)) and C-3 (27.9 L/h/m(2)). CL/BSA in C-4 was 18.1 L/h/m(2). Compared with C-2, CL/BSA increased 19% in C-3 (GM ratio 1.19; 90% CI 0.74-1.91), but decreased 23% in C-4 (0.77; 0.39-1.53). Cabazitaxel free fraction was unaltered. No significant correlation was found between grade 3-4 toxicities and pharmacokinetic parameters.CONCLUSIONS: Mild-moderate HI did not cause substantial decline in cabazitaxel clearance. Cabazitaxel dose reductions in patients with mild-moderate HI, and a contraindication in patients with severe HI, are justified based on safety data.	NA	0
28060373	Small round blue cell tumors of the sinonasal tract: a differential diagnosis approach.	One of the most challenging diagnostic categories within tumors of the sinonasal tract is the small round blue cell tumors. Biopsies are usually small and limited, resulting in considerable diagnostic difficulty for practicing surgical pathologists. These tumors share several overlapping histologic and immunophenotypic findings while also showing considerable variation within and between cases. Specific tumor site of origin, imaging findings, and clinical findings must be combined with the histology and pertinent ancillary studies if the correct diagnosis is to be reached. Discrimination between neoplasms is critical as there are significant differences in therapy and overall outcome. It is important to have a well developed differential diagnosis for this category of tumors, where each of the diagnoses is considered, evaluated, and either confirmed or excluded from further consideration. In an undifferentiated tumor, showing a small round blue cell morphology, using the mnemonic 'MR SLEEP' helps to highlight tumors to consider: melanoma, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma (including NUT carcinoma), small cell osteosarcoma, lymphoma, esthesioneuroblastoma (olfactory neuroblastoma), Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor, pituitary adenoma, and plasmacytoma. A panel of pertinent immunohistochemistry studies, histochemistries and/or molecular tests should aid in reaching a diagnosis, especially when taking the pattern and intensity of reactions into consideration.

28060372	Morphologic diversity in human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: Catch Me If You Can!	As the human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma epidemic has developed in the past several decades, it has become clear that these tumors have a wide variety of morphologic tumor types and features. For the practicing pathologist, it is critical to have a working knowledge about these in order to make the correct diagnosis, not to confuse them with other lesions, and to counsel clinicians and patients on their significance (or lack of significance) for treatment and outcomes. In particular, there are a number of pitfalls and peculiarities regarding HPV-related tumors and their nodal metastases that can easily result in misclassification and confusion. This article will discuss the various morphologic types and features of HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinomas, specific differential diagnoses when challenging, and, if established, the clinical significance of each finding.

28060371	Basaloid/blue salivary gland tumors.	Basaloid tumors are a common diagnostic problem in salivary gland pathology. However, delineating each of these tumor types is facilitated by an algorithmic approach incorporated by tumor border and cell types. This approach greatly diminishes the challenge of separating polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) from adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). Despite the overlap in growth pattern, ACC is biphasic while PLGA is not. More relevant challenges, namely differentiation of the biphasic basaloid neoplasms including: epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma (EMCA), cellular pleomorphic adenoma (PA), basal cell adenoma (BCA), and basal cell adenocarcinoma (BCAC), are resolved by a combination of morphologic, immunophenotypic, and to a limited extent, molecular features. Among the most challenging scenarios is high-grade transformation of any of the aforementioned entities. Here, the diagnosis requires recognition of a conventional component and exclusion of metastatic (or in some cases primary) SCC and even select neuroendocrine carcinomas and sarcomas in some cases.

28060370	Diagnosing the most common odontogenic cystic and osseous lesions of the jaws for the practicing pathologist.	Odontogenic cysts and osseous lesions are often seen as challenging diagnostic lesions but the majority of them are easily classified. This article outlines the diagnostic features required for separating the most common of odontogenic cysts and select osseous lesions of the jaws. Clinical and radiographic findings of these jaw lesions often lead to a differential diagnosis that only the histologic findings will clarify. Dentigerous cyst, keratocystic odontogenic tumor, and certain ameloblastomas that have cystic change, may have identical radiographic findings, with only separation by their specific histologic features leading to the significantly different treatments required for each. Conversely, some cystic lesions can appear histologically identical and cannot be diagnosed without the radiographic findings. Certain osseous lesions of the jaws are particularly problematic for diagnosis without the appropriate radiographic findings, and the diagnosis should probably not be attempted on the histologic findings alone. This article will integrate the necessary clinical, radiographic, and histologic findings required to address the most common odontogenic lesions.	NA	0
28060369	Virus-associated neoplasms of the nasopharynx and sinonasal tract: diagnostic problems.	A significant fraction of nasopharyngeal and sinonasal tumors are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or human papillomavirus (HPV). Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma harbor EBV in practically all cases, although a small proportion of cases of the former harbor HPV. Sinonasal inverted papillomas harbor HPV in about 25% of cases. Sinonasal squamous cell carcinomas harbor transcriptionally active HPV in about 20% of cases, and limited data suggest that this subset has a better prognosis than the HPV-negative subset. This review addresses the diagnostic issues of the EBV-associated tumors. Difficulties in diagnosis of NPC may be encountered when there are prominent crush artifacts, many admixed lymphoid cells masking the neoplastic cells, or numerous interspersed granulomas, whereas benign cellular components (epithelial crypts and germinal centers) and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia can potentially be mistaken for NPC. Immunostaining for pan-cytokeratin and/or in situ hybridization for EBER can help in confirming or refuting a diagnosis of NPC. The main diagnostic problem of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is recognition of the neoplastic nature of those examples predominated by small cells or showing a mixture of cells. The identification of a destructive infiltrate (dense expansile infiltrate; angiocentric growth) and definite cytologic atypia (clear cells; many medium-sized cells) would favor a diagnosis of lymphoma, which can be supported by immunohistochemistry (most commonly CD3+, CD5-, CD56+) and in situ hybridization for EBER. In conclusion, among nasopharyngeal and sinonasal neoplasms, demonstration of EBV may aid in diagnosis, particularly NPC and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Demonstration of HPV does not have a role yet in diagnosis, although this may change in the future.	NA	0
28060368	Squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract: dysplasia and select variants.	Upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) mucosal premalignant lesions include non-keratinizing and keratinizing intraepithelial dysplasia. The keratinizing type of intraepithelial dysplasia represents the majority of UADT dysplasias. Historically, grading of UADT dysplasias has followed a three tier system to include mild, moderate and severe dysplasia. Recent recommendations have introduced a two tier grading scheme to including low-grade (ie, mild dysplasia) and high-grade (moderate and severe dysplasia/carcinoma in situ) providing for better consensus among pathologists in the interpretation of such dysplastic lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant neoplasm of the UADT. Several variants of squamous cell carcinoma are recognized among which the more common types include papillary squamous cell carcinoma, verrucous carcinoma, spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma (sarcomatoid carcinoma) and basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. Each of these variants of squamous cell carcinoma poses diagnostic challenges and each correlates to specific therapy and prognosis. This review details the proposed update in the grading of UADT dysplasia to a two-tiered system as well as providing the key diagnostic features for select variants of squamous cell carcinoma.	NA	0
28060367	Applications of molecular testing in surgical pathology of the head and neck.	Molecular testing in routine surgical pathology is becoming an important component of the workup of many different types of tumors. In fact, in some organ systems, guidelines now suggest that the standard of care is to obtain specific molecular panels for tumor classification and/or therapeutic planning. In the head and neck, clinically applicable molecular tests are not as abundant as in other organ systems. Most current head and neck biomarkers are utilized for diagnosis rather than as companion diagnostic tests to predict therapeutic response. As the number of potential molecular biomarker assays increases and cost pressures escalate, the pathologist must be able to navigate the molecular testing pathways. This review explores scenarios in which molecular testing might be beneficial and cost-effective in head and neck pathology.	NA	0
28060365	Newly described salivary gland tumors.	This review concentrates on three salivary gland tumors that have been accepted in the recent literature as new neoplastic entities: mammary analog secretory carcinoma (MASC), sclerosing polycystic adenoma (SPA) and cribriform adenocarcinoma of tongue and other minor salivary glands (CAMSGs). MASC is a distinctive low-grade malignant salivary cancer that harbors a characteristic chromosomal translocation, t(12;15) (p13;q25) resulting in an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. SPA is a rare lesion often mistaken histologically for low-grade salivary carcinoma. Previously thought to be a reactive fibroinflammatory process, but recent evidence of clonality, recurrences in up 30%, and dysplastic foci suggest it may be truly neoplastic. CAMSG is a distinct tumor entity that differs from polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) by location (ie, most often arising on the tongue), by prominent nuclear clearing, alterations of the PRKD gene family and clinical behavior with frequent metastases at the time of presentation of the primary tumor. Early metastatic disease seen in most cases of CAMSG associated with indolent behavior makes it a unique neoplasm among all low-grade salivary gland tumors. Salivary glands may give rise to a wide spectrum of different tumors. They are often diagnostically challenging as morphological features often overlap between different entities. Although conventional morphology in combination with immunohistochemical findings still provide the most important clues for diagnosis, recent advances in molecular pathology offer new diagnostic tools in investigating the differential diagnosis, as well as providing potentially valuable prognostic indicators. In the last two decades, several new salivary gland tumor entities have been described, namely MASC, SPA and CAMSGs.	NA	0
28059101	Steroid hormone synthesis by the ovarian stroma surrounding epithelial ovarian tumors: a potential mechanism in ovarian tumorigenesis.	Epithelial ovarian tumors are responsive to steroid hormone stimulation and the ovarian stroma may have a direct role in this process. We evaluated immunohistochemical markers of sex-steroid differentiation and steroidogenesis (calretinin, inhibin, steroidogenic factor 1), steroid enzymes involved in hormone biosynthesis (CYP17, CYP19, HSD17β1, AKR1C3), and hormone receptors (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and androgen receptor) in 101 epithelial ovarian tumors and in normal structures implicated in ovarian carcinogenesis (ovarian surface epithelium and cortical inclusion cysts) in an attempt to elucidate this process. We hypothesized that ovarian stroma immediately adjacent to tumors express markers of sex-steroid differentiation and steroidogenesis and steroid enzymes whereas the epithelium contains corresponding hormone receptors. As the findings in seromucinous, endometrioid, and clear cell neoplasms, tumors closely associated with endometriosis, were very similar, these were combined into a group designated 'endometriosis-related tumors.' Significantly increased expression of markers of sex-steroid differentiation and steroidogenesis was found in stroma immediately adjacent to endometriosis-related tumors (P=0.003) and mucinous tumors (primary and metastatic mucinous tumors were combined because of similar findings) (P&lt;0.0001) compared with more remote ovarian stroma. In addition, sex-steroid enzymes were increased in stroma adjacent to endometriosis-related tumors (P=0.02) and mucinous tumors (P=0.02) compared with more distant stroma. Steroid hormone receptors showed greater expression in epithelium compared with stroma in the endometriosis-related tumors (P=0.0009), low-grade serous tumors (P&lt;0.0001), and high-grade serous carcinoma (P=0.0036). In contrast, there was greater expression in stroma compared with epithelium (P&lt;0.0001) in mucinous tumors, which may be due to the fact that they are not derived from müllerian epithelium. In conclusion, our findings strongly support the view that the stroma surrounding epithelial tumors in the ovary is activated to elaborate steroid hormones which may stimulate further neoplastic growth. The precise mechanisms by which this process might occur are complex and require further investigation.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 6 January 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.219.

28059100	A tailored approach to BRAF and MLH1 methylation testing in a universal screening program for Lynch syndrome.	To determine the correlation between BRAF genotype and MLH1 promoter methylation in a screening program for Lynch syndrome (LS), a universal screening program for LS was established in two medical centers. Tumors with abnormal MLH1 staining were evaluated for both BRAF V600E genotype and MLH1 promoter methylation. Tumors positive for both were considered sporadic, and genetic testing was recommended for all others. A total 1011 colorectal cancer cases were screened for Lynch syndrome, and 148 (14.6%) exhibited absent MLH1 immunostaining. Both BRAF and MLH1 methylation testing were completed in 126 cases. Concordant results (both positive or both negative) were obtained in 86 (68.3%) and 16 (12.7%) cases, respectively, with 81% concordance overall. The positive and negative predictive values for a BRAF mutation in predicting MLH1 promoter methylation were 98.9% and 41%, respectively, and the negative predictive value fell to 15% in patients ≥70 years old. Using BRAF genotyping as a sole test to evaluate cases with absent MLH1 staining would have increased referral rates for genetic testing by 2.3-fold compared with MLH1 methylation testing alone (31% vs 13.5%, respectively, P&lt;0.01). However, a hybrid approach that reserves MLH1 methylation testing for BRAF wild-type cases only would significantly decrease the number of methylation assays performed and reduce the referral rate for genetic testing to 12.7%. A BRAF mutation has an excellent positive predictive value but poor negative predictive value in predicting MLH1 promoter methylation. A hybrid use of these tests may reduce the number of low-risk patients referred to genetic counseling and facilitate wider implementation of Lynch syndrome screening programs.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 6 January 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.211.

28059099	Biological relevance of human papillomaviruses in vulvar cancer.	The carcinogenic role of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) types in the increasing subset of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia and vulvar cancer in young women has been established. However, the actual number of vulvar cancer cases attributed to HPV is still imprecisely defined. In an attempt to provide a more precise definition of HPV-driven vulvar cancer, we performed HPV-type-specific E6*I mRNA analyses available for 20 HR-/possible HR (pHR)-HPV types, on tissue samples from 447 cases of vulvar cancer. HPV DNA genotyping was performed using SPF10-LiPA25 assay due to its high sensitivity in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Data on p16(INK4a) expression was available for comparative analysis via kappa statistics. The use of highly sensitive assays covering the detection of HPV mRNA in a broad spectrum of mucosal HPV types resulted in the detection of viral transcripts in 87% of HPV DNA+ vulvar cancers. Overall concordance between HPV mRNA+ and p16(INK4a) upregulation (strong, diffuse immunostaining in &gt;25% of tumor cells) was 92% (K=0.625, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.531-0.719). Among these cases, 83% were concordant pairs of HPV mRNA+ and p16(INK4a)+ and 9% were concordant pairs of HPV mRNA- and p16(INK4a)-. Our data confirm the biological role of HR-/pHR-HPV types in the great majority of HPV DNA+ vulvar cancers, resulting in an HPV-attributable fraction of at least 21% worldwide. Most HPV DNA+ vulvar cancers were associated with HPV16 (85%), but a causative role for other, less frequently occurring mucosal HPV types (HPV26, 66, 67, 68, 70 and 73) was also confirmed at the mRNA level for the first time. These findings should be taken into consideration for future screening options as HPV-associated vulvar preneoplastic lesions have increased in incidence in younger women and require different treatment than vulvar lesions that develop from rare autoimmune-related mechanisms in older women.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 6 January 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.197.

28059098	Somatostatin receptor expression related to TP53 and RB1 alterations in pancreatic and extrapancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms with a Ki67-index above 20⁒.	Somatostatin receptor 2A expression is a feature of well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms and is important for their diagnosis and therapy. Little is known about somatostatin receptor 2A expression in poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms in relation to TP53 and RB1 status and how these features may contribute to the separation of well from poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms with a proliferation index above 20%. This study investigates the expression of somatostatin receptors, p53 and Rb1, and TP53 alterations in pancreatic and extrapancreatic well and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms (Ki67-index &gt;20%). Thirty-seven poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms of pancreatic (n=12) and extrapancreatic origin (n=25) as well as 10 well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms of the pancreas (n=9) and rectum (n=1) with a Ki67-index &gt;20% were immunostained for synaptophysin, chromogranin A, Ki67, CD56, p53, Rb1, ATRX, DAXX, progesterone receptor, somatostatin receptor 2A, somatostatin receptor 5, and cytokeratin 20, and sequenced for TP53, exons 5-9. Somatostatin receptor 2A was positive in 6/37 of poorly differentiated and in 8/10 of well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms. One well-differentiated and two poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms expressed somatostatin receptor 5. Abnormal nuclear p53 and Rb1 staining was found in 29/37 and 22/37 poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms, respectively, whereas all well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms showed normal p53 and Rb1 expression. TP53 gene alterations were restricted to poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms (24/34) and correlated well with p53 expression. All cases were progesterone receptor negative. Somatostatin receptor 2A expression is not limited to well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms but also occurs in 16% of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms from various sites. Most poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms are characterized by TP53 alterations and Rb1 loss, usually in the absence of somatostatin receptor 2A expression. In the pancreas, these criteria contribute to separate well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms with a Ki67-index above 20% from poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 6 January 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.217.

28059097	Fibrous hamartoma of infancy: a clinicopathologic study of 145 cases, including 2 with sarcomatous features.	Fibrous hamartoma of infancy is a rare soft tissue lesion of infants and young children with characteristic triphasic morphology, which typically occurs in the axilla and less commonly in other locations. We reviewed 145 cases of fibrous hamartoma of infancy from our consultation archives. Cases occurred in 106 males and 39 females (mean age-15 months; range-birth to 14 years), and involved both typical sites (eg, axilla/back/upper arm) (n=69) and unusual locations (n=76). Six were congenital. The tumors presented as subcutaneous masses and ranged from 0.4 to 17 cm (mean 3 cm). All displayed triphasic morphology, but varied widely in the relative percentages of fat, fibroblastic fascicles, and primitive mesenchyme. Hyalinized zones with cracking artifact, mimicking giant cell fibroblastoma, were present in a 44 (30%) of cases; however FISH for PDGFB gene rearrangement was negative in five tested cases. In addition to classical fibrous hamartoma of infancy, two lesions contained large sarcomatous-appearing foci with high cellularity, high nuclear grade, and brisk mitotic activity. One occurred in a 10-month-old female as a new mass in a congenital fibrous hamartoma of infancy; the other occurred as a leg mass in a 6-year-old male. ETV6 gene rearrangement was negative in the tumor from the 10-month-old female. Genomic microarray (OncoScan) showed normal molecular karyotype in eight tested cases, whereas the two tumors with sarcomatous features showed a hyperdiploid/near tetraploid molecular karyotype with copy neutral loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p and 11p, and loss of 10p, chromosome 14, and a large portion of chromosome 22q (22q11.23q13.33), respectively. Follow-up (52 patients; range: 1-208 months, median: 8 months) showed only two local recurrences and no metastases. Extensive local disease in the 10-month-old female with sarcomatous-appearing fibrous hamartoma of infancy necessitated forequarter amputation. In summary, our study confirms the classic clinicopathologic features, including the triphasic morphologic appearance of most cases. In contrast to earlier studies, our series illustrates a broader histologic spectrum than previously appreciated, including its close resemblance to giant cell fibroblastoma in one quarter of cases and the rare presence of 'sarcomatous' areas, the latter providing evidence that these are complex neoplasms rather than hamartomas.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 6 January 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.215.

28059096	Colorectal mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas and neuroendocrine carcinomas are genetically closely related to colorectal adenocarcinomas.	Colorectal mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas are rare and clinically aggressive neoplasms with considerable morphological heterogeneity. Data on their genomic characteristics and molecular associations to either conventional colorectal adenocarcinomas or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms is still scarce, hampering optimized patient treatment and care. Tissue from 19 colorectal mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas and eight colorectal poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms (neuroendocrine carcinomas) was microdissected and subjected to next-generation sequencing using a colorectal adenocarcinoma-specific panel comprising 196 amplicons covering 32 genes linked to colorectal adenocarcinoma, and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm tumorigenesis. Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas were also examined for microsatellite instability and MLH-1 promoter methylation status. In three mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas, exocrine and endocrine components were analyzed separately. Genetic testing of colorectal mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas identified 43 somatic mutations clustering in 13/32 genes. Sixteen (84%) tumors harbored at least one somatic mutation, two tumors (11%) displayed high microsatellite instability. Compared with colorectal adenocarcinomas, mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas were more frequently BRAF (37%; P=0.006), and less frequently KRAS (21%; P=0.043) and APC (16%; P=0.001) mutated. Point mutations in neuroendocrine neoplasm-related genes like RB1 or RET were not detected, but one tumor harbored a heterozygous RB1 deletion. Separately analyzed adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma components revealed a shared mutational trunk of driver genes involved in colorectal adenocarcinoma carcinogenesis. Colorectal neuroendocrine carcinomas were similar in their mutation profile to colorectal adenocarcinomas, but compared with mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas, had a higher rate of APC mutations (P=0.027). Our data indicate that colorectal mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas and neuroendocrine carcinomas are genetically closely related to colorectal adenocarcinomas, suggesting that the cells giving rise to these tumors primarily have an intestinal coinage. The identification of BRAF mutations and the frequently present KRAS wild-type status principally render some mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas eligible to targeted treatment strategies used for colorectal adenocarcinomas.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 6 January 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.220.

28059095	H3F3 mutation status of giant cell tumors of the bone, chondroblastomas and their mimics: a combined high resolution melting and pyrosequencing approach.	Behjati et al recently described recurrent mutations of H3F3 genes in giant cell tumors of the bone and chondroblastomas. Both these entities belong to the spectrum of giant cell-rich bone lesions, often presenting a diagnostic challenge for the pathologist. Our aim was to investigate the value of searching for H3F3 mutations in the diagnosis of giant cell tumors of the bone and giant cell-rich chondroblastomas. Two hundred eighty-one bone lesion samples, including 170 giant cell tumors of the bone, 26 chondroblastomas and 85 other giant cell-rich and/or epiphyseal tumors, were analyzed. Mutation status was determined using first high resolution melting screening and then mutation profiling pyrosequencing. Mutational status was compared with clinical data and, for giant cell tumors of the bone, with p63 immunostaining status. As histone methylation changes have been reported in association with H3F3 mutations, the methylation status of lysine 37 was investigated. H3F3A and H3F3B were found in 85% of giant cell tumors of the bone and 88% of chondroblastomas. In addition to the major G35W mutation, we found two rare H3F3A mutations: one G35R and one G35V. Among the other tumors studied, we only found H3F3A gene mutations in two cases of 'dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma mimicking giant cell tumor of the bone'. A H3F3B mutation was also observed in one case of dedifferentiated chondroblastoma. P63 expression in giant cell tumors of the bone seems to be associated with H3F3 gene mutations (P=0.004). H3F3 mutations did not correlate with clinical data, outcome or methylation changes in Lysin 37. In conclusion, H3F3 mutations are sensitive and specific markers of giant cell tumors of the bone and chondroblastomas. High resolution melting and pyrosequencing procedures are high-performance tools in this context. Determination of H3F3 mutation will allow reclassification of some entities belonging to the spectrum of giant cell-rich lesions.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 6 January 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.212.

28059094	Heterogeneous expression of PD-L1 in pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma: implications for assessment by small biopsy.	Predicting response to checkpoint blockade therapy for lung cancer has largely focused on measuring programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on tumor cells. PD-L1 expression is geographically heterogeneous within many tumors, however, and we questioned whether small tissue samples, such as biopsies, might be sufficiently representative of PD-L1 expression for evaluating this marker in lung cancer tumors. To evaluate the extent of variability of PD-L1 expression in small tissue samples, and how that variability affects accuracy of overall assessment of PD-L1 in lung cancer, we scored immunohistochemical staining for PD-L1 in tissue microarray cores from a series of 79 squamous cell lung cancers and 71 pulmonary adenocarcinomas. Our study found substantial inconsistencies for the percentages of cells staining positive for PD-L1 among different tissue microarray cores in many cases of both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. This variable scoring was seen at both high levels and low levels of PD-L1 expression, and by further evaluation of cases with discordant results on full-face sections to assess geographic distribution of staining, we found that discordant results among different tissue microarray cores reflected geographic variation of PD-L1 expression in those tumors. Moreover, we found that as a result of heterogeneous expression, the sensitivity of a single small tissue sample can be as low as 85% for detecting PD-L1 expression at scoring thresholds commonly used in clinical practice. Based on these studies, we conclude that many cases of lung cancer could be inaccurately or variably scored for PD-L1 expression with a single biopsy sample. Accordingly, lung cancer patients can be inconsistently classified for PD-L1 expression status, particularly when a threshold for the percentage of positive cells is used to determine eligibility for checkpoint blockade therapy.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 6 January 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.213.

28059093	Expression of PD-L1 and presence of CD8-positive T cells in pre-treatment specimens of locally advanced cervical cancer.	Several of the cancer immunotherapies under investigation or in clinical use target the programmed death-ligand 1/programmed death-1 (PD-L1/PD-1) signaling axis. PD-L1 expression in tumor samples has been used as a predictive marker for response to these therapeutics, and may also have independent prognostic utility when assessed along with immune cell markers. Our objectives were to assess the expression of PD-L1 in tumor specimens from a uniformly treated patient cohort with locally advanced cervical cancer, and to determine its prognostic significance along with the density of tumor-infiltrating T cells. We identified 120 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with radical chemoradiotherapy, and built tissue microarrays from their formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pre-treatment biopsies. We used conventional brightfield and fluorescence immunohistochemistry to detect PD-L1, and quantified protein expression using both manual pathologist scoring and automated software analysis. We also evaluated the effect of PD-L1 expression in tumors, along with the presence and density of intra-tumoral CD8(+) T cells, on patient survival outcomes. Approximately 96% of the tumor samples expressed PD-L1, as determined using quantitative software analysis. Neither expression of PD-L1 nor density of CD8(+) T cells was associated with progression-free or overall survival. However, there was a trend towards worse progression-free survival in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 but lacked CD8(+) T cells (hazard ratio=0.43 (0.18-1.01), P=0.053). Nevertheless, the high percentage of cervical cancer tumor samples expressing PD-L1 suggests that anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 therapies are potential treatment options for this patient population.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 6 January 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.221.

28059092	Bone marrow morphology and disease progression in congenital thrombocytopenia: a detailed clinicopathologic and genetic study of eight cases.	Patients with congenital thrombocytopenia have an increased risk of developing myeloid neoplasms. In these cases, the morphologic distinction between disease at baseline and at progression is challenging. This report analyzes clinicopathologic features of congenital thrombocytopenia with long-term follow-up at one referral center. Records from the last 20 years were searched for cases of congenital thrombocytopenia with bone marrow biopsies and peripheral blood smears. The clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular features were analyzed. Six adult and two pediatric patients were identified (six male, two female). Age range at first biopsy was 1-47 (median, 31) years. Underlying diseases included thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome, congenital thrombocytopenia with radial-ulnar synostosis, MYH9-related disorder, shortened telomere syndrome, congenital thrombocytopenia with ANKRD26 mutation, and familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia. Four patients had myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm-like marrow changes such as hypercellularity, increased myeloid to erythroid ratio, numerous micromegakaryocytes (highlighted by CD42b), and marrow fibrosis. Two patients had marrow hypoplasia and two had unremarkable marrow morphology. Three patients-all in the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm-like group-developed disease progression characterized by erythroid and myeloid dysplasia, elevated bone marrow blasts, and new cytogenetic abnormalities. Unlike non-familial myeloid neoplasms, congenital thrombocytopenia patients in the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm-like group had a long and indolent clinical course (average age at disease progression, 47 years). In summary, three distinct morphologic types of congenital thrombocytopenia were identified: a hyperplastic myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm-like group, a hypoplastic bone marrow failure-like group, and a group with relatively normal marrow morphology. Emergence of cytogenetic abnormalities and dysplasia in non-megakaryocyte lineages correlated with disease progression.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 6 January 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.218.

28059091	Identification of distinct subgroups of EBV-positive post-transplant diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder is an aggressive complication of transplantation, most frequently of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma morphology and associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection/reactivation. In this study the microenvironment of EBV(+) (n=23) and EBV(-) (n=9) post-transplant non-germinal center B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was characterized. Of EBV(+) cases somatic hypermutation analysis, gene expression profiling, and extensive phenotyping were performed. Our results demonstrated variable cytotoxic T-cell infiltration and significantly increased CD163(+) M2 macrophage infiltration in EBV(+) compared with EBV(-) post-transplant diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. On the basis of IgM staining and hypermutation analysis, two EBV(+) post-transplant diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subgroups were identified: IgM(+) tumors lacking somatic hypermutations and IgM(-) tumors harboring somatic hypermutations. IgM(-) tumors arose late following transplantation (median interval: 16 months), mainly in kidney recipients. IgM(+) tumors on the other hand arose early (median interval: 3 months, P-value=0.0032), almost exclusively following stem cell transplantation and were associated with worse outcome (median survival 1 month for IgM(+) versus 41 months for IgM(-) tumors, log-rank/Wilcoxon P-value 0.07/0.04). Notably, IgM(+) tumors were characterized by plasma cell features (monotypic kappa/lambda expression, high MUM1 expression, and partial CD138 expression) and a high proliferation index. Consistent with the plasma cell phenotype, unfolded protein response signaling was upregulated. In contrast, IgM(-) EBV(+) post-transplant diffuse large B-cell lymphoma did not express kappa, lambda, IgD, or CD138 and expressed limited MUM1. In these tumors T-cell signaling was enhanced associated with increased T-cell infiltration compared with IgM(+) cases. Overall, our results allow further molecular classification of EBV(+) post-transplant diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and provide a rationale for the use of subtype-specific-targeted therapies (eg, bortezomib in IgM(+) tumors). Our findings also provide a biological basis for the clinical differences between post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder following solid organ and stem cell transplantation, which are regarded as different disorders.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 6 January 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.199.

28057717	Pathology-driven Comprehensive Proteomic Profiling of the Prostate Cancer Tumour Microenvironment.	Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. Gleason grading is an important predictor of PCa outcomes and is influential in determining patient treatment options. Clinical decisions based on a Gleason score of 7 are difficult as the prognosis for individuals diagnosed with Gleason 4+3 cancer is much worse than for those diagnosed with Gleason 3+4 cancer. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) is a highly precise method to isolate specific cell populations or discrete microregions from tissues. This report undertook a detailed molecular characterization of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in PCa to define the proteome in the epithelial and stromal regions from tumor foci of Gleason grade 3 and 4. Tissue regions of interest were isolated from several Gleason 3+3 and Gleason 4+4 tumors using telepathology to leverage specialized pathology expertise to support LCM. Over 2,000 proteins were identified following liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of all regions of interest. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in protein expression (&gt;100 proteins) between Gleason 3 and Gleason 4 regions - in both stromal and epithelial compartments. A subset of these proteins has had prior strong association with PCa, thereby providing evidence for the authenticity of the approach. Finally, validation of these proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been obtained using an independent cohort of PCa tumor specimens.IMPLICATIONS: This unbiased strategy provides a strong foundation for the development of biomarker protein panels with significant diagnostic and prognostic potential.

28057716	miR-211-5p Suppresses Metastatic Behavior by Targeting SNAI1 in Renal Cancer.	The snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (SNAI1) is known to promote metastatic phenotypes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, the mechanism by which SNAI1 promotes RCC metastasis remains largely unexplored. Here, bioinformatics and quantitative validation revealed that miR-211-5p was downregulated in metastatic RCC clinical specimens compared to non-metastatic RCC tissues. Overexpression of miR-211-5p suppressed RCC cell migration and invasion via downregulation of SNAI1 expression. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-211-5p directly targeted 3'-UTR of SNAI1. Furthermore, miR-211-5p decreased xenograft tumor weight and reduced in vivo tumor metastasis in mice. These findings indicate that miR-211-5p-mediated inhibition of SNAIL1 expression contributes to the suppression of RCC progression.IMPLICATIONS: Targeting the miR-211-5p/SNAI1 signaling pathway may be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of RCC metastasis.

28059072	Hollow boron nitride nanospheres as boron reservoir for prostate cancer treatment.	High global incidence of prostate cancer has led to a focus on prevention and treatment strategies to reduce the impact of this disease in public health. Boron compounds are increasingly recognized as preventative and chemotherapeutic agents. However, systemic administration of soluble boron compounds is hampered by their short half-life and low effectiveness. Here we report on hollow boron nitride (BN) spheres with controlled crystallinity and boron release that decrease cell viability and increase prostate cancer cell apoptosis. In vivo experiments on subcutaneous tumour mouse models treated with BN spheres demonstrated significant suppression of tumour growth. An orthotopic tumour growth model was also utilized and further confirmed the in vivo anti-cancer efficacy of BN spheres. Moreover, the administration of hollow BN spheres with paclitaxel leads to synergetic effects in the suppression of tumour growth. The work demonstrates that hollow BN spheres may function as a new agent for prostate cancer treatment.	NA	0
28059068	CDK4/6 or MAPK blockade enhances efficacy of EGFR inhibition in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma is a deadly disease where systemic therapy has relied upon empiric chemotherapy despite the presence of genomic alterations pointing to candidate therapeutic targets, including recurrent amplification of the gene encoding receptor tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here, we demonstrate that EGFR-targeting small-molecule inhibitors have efficacy in EGFR-amplified oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but may become quickly ineffective. Resistance can occur following the emergence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and by reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway following EGFR blockade. We demonstrate that blockade of this rebound activation with MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) inhibition enhances EGFR inhibitor-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and delays resistance to EGFR monotherapy. Furthermore, genomic profiling shows that cell cycle regulators are altered in the majority of EGFR-amplified tumours and a combination of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) and EGFR inhibitors prevents the emergence of resistance in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that upfront combination strategies targeting EGFR amplification, guided by adaptive pathway reactivation or by co-occurring genomic alterations, should be tested clinically.	therapeutic	1

28058493	Outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia harboring trisomy 8.	Trisomy 8 (+8) is one of the most common cytogenetic abnormalities in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in adult patients with AML harboring +8 remains unclear. To evaluate, the outcome and prognostic factors in patients with AML harboring +8 as the only chromosomal abnormality or in association with other abnormalities, we retrospectively analyzed the Japanese registration data of 631 adult patients with AML harboring +8 treated with allogeneic HSCT between 1990 and 2013. In total, 388 (61%) patients were not in remission at the time of HSCT. With a median follow-up of 38.5 months, the probability of overall survival and the cumulative incidence of relapse at 3 years were 40 and 34%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, two or more additional cytogenetic abnormalities and not being in remission at the time of HSCT were significantly associated with a higher overall mortality and relapse. Nevertheless, no significant impact on the outcome was observed in cases with one cytogenetic abnormality in addition to +8. Although more than 60% of the patients received HSCT when not in remission, allogeneic HSCT offered a curative option for adult patients with AML harboring +8.	NA	0
28058491	Evaluating the impact of genetic and epigenetic aberrations on survival and response in acute myeloid leukemia patients receiving epigenetic therapy.	Treatment with hypomethylating agents such as decitabine, which results in overall response rates of up to 50%, has become standard of care in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy. However, there still exists a lack of prognostic and predictive molecular biomarkers that enable selection of patients who are likely to benefit from epigenetic therapy. Here, we investigated distinct genetic (FLT3-ITD, NPM1, DNMT3A) and epigenetic (estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), C/EBPα, and OLIG2) aberrations in 87 AML patients from the recently published phase II decitabine trial (AML00331) to identify potential biomarkers for patients receiving hypomethylating therapy. While FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutational status were not associated with survival or response to therapy, patients harboring DNMT3A R882 mutations showed a non-significant association towards shorter overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-5.12, p = 0.08). Promoter DNA methylation analyses using pyrosequencing also revealed a non-significant association towards shorter overall survival of patients with higher levels of methylation of ERα (HR 1.50, CI 0.97-2.32, p = 0.07) and OLIG2 CpG4 (HR 1.52, CI 0.96-2.41, p = 0.08), while DNA methylation of C/EBPα showed no association with outcome. Importantly, in multivariate analyses adjusted for clinical baseline parameters, the impact of ERα and OLIG2 CpG4 methylation was conserved (HR 1.76, CI 1.01-3.06, p = 0.05 and HR 1.67, CI 0.91-3.08, p = 0.10, respectively). In contrast, none of the investigated genetic and epigenetic markers was associated with response to treatment. Additional to the previously reported adverse prognostic clinical parameters such as patients' age, reduced performance status, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, DNMT3A R882 mutation status, as well as ERα and OLIG2 CpG4 DNA methylation status, may prove to be molecular markers in older AML patients prior to hypomethylating therapy.	therapeutic	1
28058490	Second line azacitidine for elderly or infirmed patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) not eligible for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation-a retrospective national multicenter study.	Elderly and infirm patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with either induction refractory or relapse disease may benefit from treatment with azacitidine. We retrospectively reviewed the data from five tertiary centers in Israel, treated between 2009 and 2015. Thirty-four patients (median age 74 years) were identified. Sixty-two percent of the patients had relapsed disease and 38% had refractory disease. Median time of follow-up was 12.1 months. Out of a total of 327 courses, incidence of infectious episodes was 6%. Eighteen percent experienced major bleeding. Thirty-two percent of the patients achieved morphologic complete remission, and 26% had stabilization of disease during at least three courses. At 12 and 18 months after the first course of azacitidine, 33 and 10% of the patients were progression-free, respectively. Incidences of overall survival at 12 and 24 months were 54.5 and 16%, respectively. Age &lt;75 years was associated with better overall survival. Normal leukocyte count at the first dose of azacitidine and standard doses of azacitidine were both associated with a better progression-free and overall survival. We conclude that azacitidine is feasible in patients who have failed induction chemotherapy and may be associated with prolongation of survival. A prospective trial to validate these results is warranted.	NA	0
28058563	Long-Term Satisfaction and Body Image After Contralateral Prophylactic Mastectomy.	BACKGROUND: Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) rates have been increasing in the US, and although high levels of satisfaction with CPM have been reported, few studies have evaluated the long-term effects on body image, comparing CPM with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and unilateral mastectomy (UM).METHODS: We analyzed responses from a survey of women with both a personal and family history of breast cancer who were enrolled in the Sister Study (n = 1176). Among women who underwent mastectomy, we examined satisfaction with the mastectomy decision, as well as variation in the use of reconstruction and experience of complications. Five survey items, evaluated individually and as a summed total score, were used to compare body image across surgery types (BCS, UM without reconstruction, CPM without reconstruction, UM with reconstruction, and CPM with reconstruction).RESULTS: Participants were, on average, 3.6 years post-diagnosis at the time of survey (standard deviation 1.7). The majority of women (97% of CPM, 89% of UM) were satisfied with their mastectomy decision. Reconstruction was more common after CPM than after UM (70 vs. 47%), as were complications (28 vs. 19%). Body image scores were significantly worse among women who underwent CPM than among women who underwent BCS, with the lowest scores among women who underwent CPM without reconstruction.CONCLUSIONS: In our sample, most women were highly satisfied with their mastectomy decision, including those who elected to undergo CPM. However, body image was lower among those who underwent CPM than among those who underwent BCS. Our findings may inform decisions among women considering various courses of surgical treatment.	NA	0
28058562	Effectiveness of Repeat 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography Computerized Tomography (PET-CT) Scan in Identifying Interval Metastases for Patients with Esophageal Cancer.	INTRODUCTION: An 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computerized tomography (PET-CT) scan is performed after neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) to restage esophageal cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of PET-CT to accurately identify interval metastatic disease following nCRT.METHODS: This was a single-institution retrospective review (January 2005-February 2012) of patients with esophageal cancer treated with nCRT who underwent pre- and post-nCRT PET-CT.RESULTS: A total of 283 patients were treated with nCRT, of whom 258 (91.2%) had both a pre- and post-nCRT PET-CT. On the post-nCRT PET-CT, 64 patients (24.8%) had interval findings concerning for metastatic disease. Of these patients, only 10 (15.6%) had true-positive findings of metastatic disease (six biopsy proven). The sites of interval metastases included bone (4), liver (3), peritoneum (1), mediastinal lymph nodes (1), and cervical lymph nodes (1). The positive predictive value of post-nCRT PET-CT for interval metastases was 15.6% (10/64), and the yield for detecting metastases since the pre-nCRT PET-CT was 3.9% (10/258). The work-up of the 54 patients (20.9% of the initial starting group) with false-positive post-nCRT findings included biopsy (24.6%) and immediate additional imaging (45.2%). A total of 208 patients proceeded with surgery: 163 (78.4%) had no new findings on post-nCRT PET-CT, and 45 (21.6%) had new false-positive findings. False-positive sites mainly included the lung (15) and liver (14).CONCLUSIONS: The yield of post-nCRT PET-CT for the detection of new metastatic disease was 3.9%. Post-nCRT PET-CT often leads to a high proportion of false positives and subsequent investigational work-up.	NA	0
28058561	Percutaneous Peritoneal Lavage for the Rapid Staging of Gastric and Pancreatic Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Positive peritoneal cytology is classified as M1 disease in gastric and pancreatic cancer. While peritoneal cytology is typically obtained by laparoscopic peritoneal lavage, this study sought to examine the feasibility and safety of performing this percutaneously, with monitored anesthesia care and in combination with other diagnostic procedures to condense and expedite the staging process.METHODS: Patients with gastric or pancreatic cancer scheduled for laparoscopy with peritoneal lavage were prospectively enrolled to undergo intraoperative percutaneous peritoneal lavage prior to laparoscopic peritoneal lavage. Saline was infused through a percutaneously-inserted catheter and fluid was collected for peritoneal cytology. Three-quadrant washings collected during laparoscopy were also sent for peritoneal cytology. The primary outcome was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of percutaneous peritoneal lavage for detecting positive peritoneal cytology compared with the gold standard of laparoscopic peritoneal lavage, while the secondary outcome was to determine safety.RESULTS: Percutaneous peritoneal lavage was successfully performed in 70 of 76 patients (92%). Ten of 48 gastric cancer patients (21%) and three of 22 pancreatic cancer patients (14%) had positive percutaneous and laparoscopic peritoneal cytology. Two additional gastric cancer patients had positive laparoscopic peritoneal cytology only. Sensitivity and specificity of percutaneous peritoneal lavage compared with laparoscopic peritoneal lavage were 87% and 100%, respectively. No complications occurred with percutaneous peritoneal lavage.CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous peritoneal lavage is a safe and effective minimally invasive alternative to laparoscopic peritoneal lavage for the diagnosis of metastatic gastric and pancreatic cancer. It is possible this can be utilized in an outpatient setting, such as during endoscopy, to allow for earlier diagnosis of M1 disease and decreased time to appropriate treatment.	NA	0
28058560	Intraoperative Margin Management in Breast-Conserving Surgery: A Systematic Review of the Literature.	BACKGROUND: Breast surgeons have a wide variety of intraoperative techniques available to help achieve low rates for positive margins of excision, with variable levels of evidence.METHODS: A systematic review of the medical literature from 1995 to July 2016 was conducted, with 434 abstracts identified and evaluated. The analysis included 106 papers focused on intraoperative management of breast cancer margins and contained actionable data.RESULTS: Ultrasound-guided lumpectomy for palpable tumors, as an alternative to palpation guidance, can lower positive margin rates, but the effect when used as an alternative to wire localization (WL) for nonpalpable tumors is less certain. Localization techniques such as radioactive seed localization and radioguided occult lesion localization were found potentially to lower positive margin rates as alternatives to WL depending on baseline positive margin rates. Intraoperative pathologic methods including gross histology, frozen section analysis, and imprint cytology all have the potential to lower the rates of positive margins. Cavity-shave margins and the Marginprobe device both lower rates of positive margins, with some potential for negative cosmetic effects. Specimen radiography and multiple miscellaneous techniques did not affect positive margin rates or provided too little evidence for formation of a conclusion.CONCLUSIONS: A systematic review of the literature showed evidence that several intraoperative techniques and actions can lower the rates of positive margins. These results are presented together with graded recommendations.	NA	0
28058559	Surveillance Imaging Patterns and Outcomes Following Radiation Therapy and Radical Resection for Localized Extremity and Trunk Soft Tissue Sarcoma.	BACKGROUND: Optimal surveillance imaging (SI) regimens following radiation therapy (RT) and radical resection for localized soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are unknown and practice patterns vary.METHODS: Between 2006 and 2014, 94 patients with localized STS of the extremity/trunk treated with preoperative RT and radical resection were identified. Timing of local recurrence (LR), distant recurrence (DR), and SI were evaluated. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine recurrence-free and overall survival (OS), and the method of recurrence detection (SI or due to signs/symptoms) was determined.RESULTS: Median tumor size was 7.5 cm, and 92% were intermediate/high grade. After a median follow-up of 60 months for surviving patients, 30 patients (32%) recurred, including 5 LRs and 26 DRs. The median time to LR and DR was 36.2 months (range 14.4-65.7) and 10.4 months (range 5.2-76.9), respectively, and the 5-year local recurrence-free survival (RFS), distant RFS, and OS was 95, 71, and 76%, respectively. Local SI was performed for 90% of patients, mostly by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; 91%). Of the five LRs, two were detected by SI and three had signs/symptoms preceding imaging. All patients underwent distant SI. Of the 26 DRs, 23 (88%) were in the lung. SI detected 22 (85%) DRs, and only 4 of 26 had signs/symptoms prompting imaging.CONCLUSION: Given excellent local control with RT and radical resection for intermediate/high-grade STS of the extremity/trunk, SI of the primary site should be reserved for select patients at high risk of LR. Conversely, due to frequent occurrence of asymptomatic DR in the lungs, periodic lung SI is appropriate. Routine abdominopelvic SI may not be indicated for most histologies.	NA	0
28058558	Call for Surgical Nodal Staging in Women with ESMO/ESGO/ESTRO High-Intermediate Risk Endometrial Cancer: A Multicentre Cohort Analysis from the FRANCOGYN Study Group.	BACKGROUND: The European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO)/European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO)/European Society for Radiotherapy &amp; Oncology (ESTRO) classification for endometrial cancer (EC) now includes a high-intermediate risk (HIR) group of recurrence due to the adverse prognostic role of lymphovascular space involvement (LVSI) and grade 3 for women at intermediate risk. However, optimal surgical staging, and especially the place of lymphadenectomy, remains to be elucidated. We aimed to establish whether systematic nodal staging should be part of surgical staging for women with HIR EC.METHODS: We abstracted from a prospectively maintained multicentre database the data of 181 women with HIR EC based on uterine factors (endometrioid type 1, grade 1-2 tumors with deep (≥50%) myometrial invasion and unequivocally positive LVSI, and those with grade 3 tumors with &lt;50% myometrial invasion regardless of LVSI status), who received primary surgical treatment between January 2001 and December 2013. We recorded frequency of lymph node (LN) metastases in those who underwent nodal staging. The secondary outcomes were overall survival and recurrence patterns.RESULTS: Overall, 145 (80.1%) women underwent nodal staging consisting of at least pelvic lymphadenectomy. Of these, 62 (42.7%) had LN disease (9.7% with micrometastases). The respective 5-year overall survival rates according to LN status were 85.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76.5-91.4), 71.8% (95% CI 61.9-80.4) and 36.0% (95% CI 26.6-46.2) for women with negative LN, positive LN, and unstaged (p = 0.047). Unstaged women were more likely to experience nodal recurrence than surgically staged/LN negative women (p = 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Systematic nodal staging should be part of surgical staging for women with apparent ESMO/ESGO/ESTRO HIR EC. Sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB) could be an option in this specific setting that may possibly substitute comprehensive staging, for the identification of patients with lymphatic dissemination.	NA	0
28058557	Intraperitoneal Administration of Plasma-Activated Medium: Proposal of a Novel Treatment Option for Peritoneal Metastasis From Gastric Cancer.	BACKGROUND: The administration of fluid irradiated with non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma (NEAPP) has attracted much interest as a novel therapeutic method for cancer. The authors previously reported on the efficacy of plasma-activated medium (PAM) for treating cancer cell lines through the induction of apoptosis. In this study, the therapeutic effect of PAM was evaluated in vivo using a peritoneal metastasis mouse model.METHODS: Two gastric cancer cell lines were used in proliferation assays performed to optimize the production of PAM by changing the distance between the plasma source and the medium surface and by altering the volume of irradiated medium. Wound-healing and adhesion assays were conducted to determine the effect of PAM therapy on cell migration and adhesion capacity in vitro. Finally, a mouse model established by the intraperitoneal injection of enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged gastric cancer cells was used to explore the efficacy of PAM administered intraperitoneally in inhibiting peritoneal metastasis formation.RESULTS: Shorter distances between the plasma source and the medium surface and smaller volumes of treated medium increased the anti-tumor effect of PAM. The PAM treatment attenuated gastric cancer cell migration and adhesion in vitro. The intraperitoneal administration of PAM decreased the formation of peritoneal metastatic nodules by 60% in the mouse model, and no adverse events were observed.CONCLUSIONS: Plasma-activated liquids may represent a novel therapeutic method for the treatment of peritoneal metastases in gastric cancer.

28058556	Surgical Treatment of Malignant Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma: Retrospective Case Series.	INTRODUCTION: Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) are rare neoplasms; about 10% are malignant. Literature regarding possible benefit from resection is extremely limited.METHODS: A 20 year review of all patients undergoing surgery for malignant PPGL at the Mayo Clinic Rochester Campus between 1994 and June 2014 was performed.RESULTS: We identified 34 patients undergoing surgery for malignant PPGL. Median follow up was 6 and 5 years survival was 90% (median 11 years). Complete resection (R0) was achieved in 14 patients (41%). Median disease-free survival was 4.6 years for patients with R0 resection (up to 12 years). Only eight patients (23%) were disease-free on last follow up. Elevated preoperative fractionated metanephrines or catecholamines were documented in 23 patients (68%); these normalized in 13 of 23 patients (56%) postoperatively-with symptom relief in 15 of 18 preoperatively symptomatic patients (79%). Among 23 patients with hormone-producing tumors, significant reduction in number of antihypertensive medications was also noted postoperatively; 11 patients have remained off all antihypertensives, 6 required 1 medication, 1 required 2, while 5 required full blockade with phenoxybenzamine and a beta-adrenergic blocker.CONCLUSION: Surgery plays a significant role in the management of selected malignant PPGL. Resection can be effective in normalizing or significantly reducing levels of catecholamines and metanephrines, and can improve hormone-related symptoms and hypertension. Surgical resection, either complete or incomplete, is associated with durable survival despite a high rate of tumor recurrence.	NA	0
28058555	Commentary on the Consensus Statement of the American Society of Breast Surgeons on Contralateral Prophylactic Mastectomy.	The increasing rate of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) led the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) to issue an evidence-based consensus statement on CPM, as well as a discussion guide that health care providers can use to facilitate shared decision making with patients considering CPM for unilateral breast cancer. This article suggests several ways to improve the discussion guide by eliciting patient values and preferences and by providing more current, detailed, and balanced information about the potential risks and benefits of CPM.

28058554	Prognosis of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinomas with HBV Infection is Better than Those with Hepatolithiasis After R0 Liver Resection: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis.	BACKGROUND: The impact of different causative factors of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) on disease outcome remains largely unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the prognosis of ICC patients with different pathogenic factors after hepatectomy.METHODS: Data of 731 consecutive patients undergoing R0 liver resection for ICC at The Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital between 2004 and 2010 were analyzed. These patients were divided into the hepatitis B virus-related (HBV-ICC, n = 519), hepatolithiasis-related (stone-ICC, n = 87), HBV plus hepatolithiasis-related (HBV/stone-ICC, n = 45), and other etiologies-related (other-ICC, n = 80) ICC groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to eliminate the baseline differences between these groups.RESULTS: In these four groups, the 5-year tumor recurrence and overall survival (OS) rates were 75.4, 90.3, 83.0 and 81.9%, and 32.7, 16.3, 17.7 and 22.6%, respectively. The significant differences in recurrence and OS were identified between the HBV- and stone-ICC groups (both p &lt; 0.001). In these two groups, most of the independent prognostic predictors were similar, but tumor diameter &gt;5 cm was demonstrated as a risk factor in the HBV-ICC patients only, and surgical margin &lt;1 cm and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive were demonstrated as risk factors in the stone-ICC patients only. With PSM, 75 patients in each of the HBV- and stone-ICC cohorts were created, and the 5-year recurrence and OS rates were 69.9 versus 88.6, and 34.6 versus 19.2%, respectively (p = 0.017, 0.027).CONCLUSION: Patients with HBV-ICC achieved better outcomes than those with stone-ICC. This prognostic difference was probably associated with biological malignant invasiveness rather than tumor stage.	NA	0
28058553	Implications of Sentinel Lymph Node Drainage to Multiple Basins in Head and Neck Melanoma.	BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for head and neck melanoma is challenging due to unpredictable drainage. We sought to determine the frequency of drainage to multiple lymphatic basins and asked if this was associated with prognosis in a large, single-center cohort.METHODS: We queried patients diagnosed with head and neck melanomas who had a SLNB performed from January 1998 to April 2016. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared using Student's t test, Pearson chi-square analysis, log-rank test, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, and Kaplan-Meier curves.RESULTS: We identified 269 patients with head and neck melanoma that had SLNBs performed in the following locations: 223 neck, 92 parotid/preauricular, 29 occipital/posterior auricular, 1 axilla. There were 68 (25%) patients who had drainage to multiple basins. These patients were similar to those with single basin drainage in age, gender distribution, Breslow depth, and percent with a positive SLNB (all p &gt; 0.05). Fewer patients with drainage to multiple basins had a completion lymph node dissection (CLND, p = 0.03). A trend toward increased 3-year locoregional recurrence was seen for patients with drainage to multiple basins in univariate analysis (27% vs. 18%, p = 0.10) but was lost in multivariate analysis (p = 0.49), possibly because of higher recurrence rates in patients with positive nodes but no CLND (p = 0.02). No difference was detected for distant recurrence or overall survival based on SLN drainage.CONCLUSIONS: Head and neck melanoma SLNB drainage to multiple basins is common. Drainage to multiple basins does not seem to be associated with increased sentinel lymph node positivity, locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, or survival.	NA	0
28058552	Complications after Hepatectomy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Independently Shorten Survival: A Western, Single-Center Audit.	BACKGROUND: The impact of postoperative complications (POCs) on long-term outcomes following hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resection remains to be ascertained.METHODS: All consecutive HCC resected at a single center were analyzed. Patients with POCs, classified according to Clavien classification, were compared to those without in terms of demographics, pathology, management, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS). Independent prognostic factors of POCs were identified using multivariable regression models.RESULTS: Among 341 patients, overall POCs rate was 34% (n = 116) and grade III-IV POCs rate was 14.4% (n = 49). POCs were an independent negative factor for OS [hazard ratio (HR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-2.26, p = 0.009] with BCLC stage, the need for combined procedure, intraoperative transfusion, and the METAVIR score of the underlying parenchyma. Similarly, occurrence of POCs was associated independently with DFS (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.18-2.15, p = 0.002), together with the presence of portal hypertension, BCLC stage, the need for combined procedure, intraoperative transfusion, and the presence of satellite nodules. After stratification, the negative impact of morbidity on OS and DFS reached statistical significance in the BCLC stage A subset only (p = 0.026, and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Open resection, intraoperative transfusion, and the existence of underlying liver injury were independent predictors of POCs.CONCLUSIONS: POCs should be considered as a long-term prognostic factor. Careful patient selection requiring underlying liver assessment and appropriate strategy, such as mini-invasive surgery and restricted transfusion policy, might be promoted to prevent POCs.	NA	0
28058551	Modified Frailty Index Predicts Morbidity and Mortality After Pancreaticoduodenectomy.	BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is a disease of older adults, who may present with limited physiologic reserve. The authors hypothesized that a frailty index can predict postoperative outcomes after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD).METHODS: All patients who underwent PD were identified in the 2005-2012 NSQIP Participant Use File. Patients undergoing emergency procedures, those with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification of five, and those with a diagnosis of preoperative sepsis were excluded from the study. A modified frailty index (mFI) was defined by 11 variables within the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) previously used for the Canadian Study of Health and Aging-Frailty Index. An mFI score of 0.27 or higher was defined as a high mFI. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate postoperative outcomes.RESULTS: This study enrolled 9986 patients (age 65 ± 12 years, 48.8% female) who underwent PD. Of these patients, 6.4% (n = 637) had a high mFI (&gt;0.27). Increasing mFI was associated with higher prevalence of postoperative morbidity (p &lt; 0.001) and 30-days mortality (p &lt; 0.001). In the univariate analysis, high mFI was associated with increased morbidity (odds ratio [OR] 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43-1.97; p &lt; 0.001) and 30-days mortality (OR 2.45; 95% CI 1.74-3.45; p &lt; 0.001). After adjustment for age, sex, ASA classification, albumin level, and body mass index (BMI), high mFI remained an independent preoperative predictor of postoperative morbidity (OR 1.544; 95% CI 1.289-1.850; p &lt; 0.0001) and 30-days mortality (OR 1.536; 95% CI 1.049-2.248; p = 0.027).CONCLUSIONS: High mFI is associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality after PD and can aid in preoperative risk stratification.

28058550	Do Calcifications Seen on Mammography After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer Always Need to Be Excised?	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the relationship between mammographic calcifications and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tumoral enhancement before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and to assess the impact of these findings on surgical management.METHODS: This Institutional Review Board-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant retrospective study involved breast cancer patients who underwent NAC between 2009 and 2015. The study cohort comprised 90 patients with pre- and posttreatment MRI and mammograms demonstrating calcifications within the tumor bed either at presentation or after treatment. The data gathered included pre- and post-NAC imaging findings and post-NAC histopathology, particularly findings associated with calcifications. Comparisons were made using Fisher's exact test, with p values lower than 0.05 considered significant.RESULTS: Complete resolution of MRI enhancement occurred for 44% of the patients, and a pathologic complete response (pCR) was achieved for 32% of the patients. No statistically significant correlation between changes in mammographic calcifications and MRI enhancement was found (p = 0.12). Resolution of enhancement was strongly correlated with pCR (p &lt; 0.0001). The majority of the patients with pCR demonstrated complete resolution of enhancement (79%, 23/29). No statistically significant relationship was found between changes in calcifications and rates of pCR (p = 0.06). A pCR was achieved most frequently for patients with resolution of enhancement and new, increasing, or unchanged calcifications (p &lt; 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Although calcifications seen on post-NAC mammography may be associated with benign disease, loss of MRI enhancement does not predict the absence of residual tumor with sufficient accuracy to leave calcifications in place. Complete excision of tumor bed calcifications remains standard practice and a substantial limitation to NAC use for downstaging patients to be eligible for breast conservation treatment.	NA	0
28058549	Reliable Surgical Techniques for Lymphadenectomy Along the Left Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve During Thoracoscopic Esophagectomy in the Prone Position.	BACKGROUND: Lymphadenectomy along the left recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) in esophageal cancer is important for disease control (1) but requires advanced dissection skills. We previously reported a reliable method (2) for lymphadenectomy along the left RLN during thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the prone position (TEP). The goal of this method is complete dissection of the lymph nodes along the left RLN in a safe manner.METHOD: This procedure is performed for all resectable thoracic esophageal cancers. The essence of the method is to recognize the lateral pedicle as a two-dimensional membrane that includes the left RLN, lymph nodes, and primary esophageal arteries. By drawing the proximal portion of the divided esophagus and the lateral pedicle, identification and reliable cutting of the primary esophageal arteries, as well as distinguishing the left RLN from the lymph nodes, becomes simplified.RESULTS: We performed 46 TEPs using this method, with no conversion to an open procedure, at Kobe University in 2015. The body mass index of these patients was distributed between 19 and 32, and the mean number of harvested lymph nodes along the left RLN was 6.9 ± 4.2. Left RLN palsy greater than Clavien-Dindo classification grade II occurred in four patients (8% )without permanent paralysis, while the incidence of lymph node metastasis along the left RLN was 22%.CONCLUSIONS: Our method for lymphadenectomy along the left RLN during TEP is safe and reliable. It has a low incidence of left RLN palsy and provides sufficient lymph node dissection along the left RLN.	NA	0
28058548	Minimally Invasive and Open Approaches to Mediastinal Nodal Assessment.	There is no consensus on mediastinal lymph node dissection versus sampling for early-stage lung cancer. There are also mixed data on the ability to remove an adequate number of lymph nodes by a minimally invasive approach. In this review, we discuss the difference between dissection and sampling, what circumstances dictate the use of one or the other during an anatomic pulmonary resection for lung cancer, and when it is appropriate to use minimally invasive versus open approaches in the assessment of mediastinal nodes.

28058547	Effect of Thyroid Remnant Volume on the Risk of Hypothyroidism After Hemithyroidectomy: A Prospective Study.	BACKGROUND: Hypothyroidism is a common sequel after a hemithyroidectomy. Although various risk factors leading to hypothyroidism have been reported, the effect of the contralateral lobe's volume has been understudied. This study aimed to examine the association between the preoperative contralateral lobe's volume and the risk of postoperative hypothyroidism.METHODS: During a 2-year period, 150 eligible patients undergoing a hemithyroidectomy were evaluated. The volume of the contralateral nonexcised lobe was estimated preoperatively by independent assessors on ultrasonography using the following formula: width (in cm) × depth (in cm) × length (in cm) × (π/6), adjusted for the body surface area (BSA). Postoperative hypothyroidism was defined as serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) exceeding 4.78 mIU/L. Any significant characteristics in the univariate analysis were entered into the multivariate analysis to determine independent factors.RESULTS: After a mean follow-up period of 53.5 ± 9.4 months, 44 patients (29.3 %) experienced postoperative hypothyroidism, and 10 of these patients required thyroxine replacement. Hypothyroidism was associated with a higher preoperative TSH level (p &lt; 0.001), a smaller BSA-adjusted volume (p &lt; 0.001), fewer ipsilateral nodules (p = 0.037), and the presence of thyroiditis (p = 0.050). After adjustment for thyroiditis, preoperative TSH (p &lt; 0.001), number of ipsilateral nodules (p = 0.048), and BSA-adjusted volume (p &lt; 0.001) were independent factors for hypothyroidism. Patients with a BSA-adjusted volume smaller than 3.2 ml had a threefold greater hypothyroidism risk than those with a BSA-adjusted volume of 3.2 ml or more (p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: A significant inverse association between the preoperative contralateral lobe's volume and hypothyroidism risk was observed after hemithyroidectomy. Together with a higher preoperative TSH level and fewer ipsilateral nodules, a smaller BSA-adjusted volume measured by preoperative ultrasonography independently predicted hypothyroidism.	NA	0
28058546	Is Chemical Pyloroplasty Necessary for Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy?	BACKGROUND: Many centers use botulinum toxin for chemical pyloroplasty in minimally invasive esophagectomies as prophylaxis against delayed gastric emptying. No previous studies have compared botulinum toxin injection with no pyloric intervention for patients treated with a combined laparoscopic and thoracoscopic approach. The authors hypothesized that chemical pyloroplasty does not improve outcomes for these patients.METHODS: The study investigated patients undergoing minimally invasive esophagectomies from September 2009 to June 2015. Delayed gastric emptying was defined as inability to tolerate a soft diet by postoperative day 10, as corroborated by esophagram, upper endoscopy, or both. Data were compared using Student's t test, χ (2) analysis, and Mann-Whitney U test where appropriate.RESULTS: The study identified 71 patients treated with minimally invasive esophagectomy: 35 patients with chemical pyloroplasty treated from September 2009 to January 2014 and 36 patients without pyloric intervention from February 2014 to June 2015. The groups were statistically similar in age, gender distribution, T stage, percentage of patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy, body mass index, preoperative weight loss, preoperative serum albumin, and preoperative placement of feeding tubes (all p &gt; 0.05). The overall incidence of delayed gastric emptying was low in both groups: 8.6% (3/35) of the patients with chemical pyloroplasty versus 5.6% (2/36) of the patients with no pyloric intervention (p = 0.62). The two groups also did not differ significantly in the development of aspiration pneumonia or the need for pyloric intervention.CONCLUSIONS: In a well-matched cohort study with a historical control group, use of botulinum toxin for chemical pyloroplasty in minimally invasive esophagectomies was not associated with improved outcomes related to the pylorus versus no pyloric intervention. Although preliminary, these data suggest that chemical pyloroplasty is not necessary in minimally invasive esophagectomy.	NA	0
28058545	The Role of Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Systemic Chemotherapy with Cytoreductive Surgery and Heated Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy for Colorectal Peritoneal Metastases: A Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND: Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is an effective treatment for colorectal peritoneal metastases (CPM), increasing overall survival in selected patients. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effect of neoadjuvant and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy on overall survival in patients with CPM undergoing CRS and HIPEC, compared with those who receive CRS and HIPEC alone.METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed using the PubMed database, and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines formed the structure of the review. Data regarding publication details, study design, patient pathology, treatments received, follow-up periods, overall survival and safety were collected and tabulated, and study quality was assessed using the MINORS score for non-randomized studies.RESULTS: Sixteen of 288 studies met the inclusion criteria. Seven publications related to the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and there was no strong evidence for the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Of note, one study observed worse survival outcomes when neoadjuvant therapy was used. Fourteen studies investigated the role of adjuvant chemotherapy and there was limited evidence that adjuvant systemic chemotherapy improves survival following CRS and HIPEC.CONCLUSIONS: Systemic adjuvant chemotherapy may be associated with improved overall survival, but the role of systemic neoadjuvant chemotherapy cannot be determined by the currently available evidence. The delivery of a combination of the two modes of systemic chemotherapy has not been investigated in a randomized controlled trial to date. Further research designed to investigate the role of these modalities in the patient's treatment is required.	NA	0
28058544	Breast Malignancies in Children: Presentation, Management, and Survival.	PURPOSE: Pediatric breast malignancies are rare, and descriptions in the literature are limited. The purpose of our study was to compare pediatric and adult breast malignancy.METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using the National Cancer Data Base comparing patients ≤21 years to those &gt;21 years at diagnosis (1998-2012). Generalized linear models estimated differences in demographic, tumor, and treatment characteristics. Cox regression was used to compare overall survival.RESULTS: Of 1,999,181 cases of invasive breast malignancies, 477 (0.02%) occurred in patients ≤21 years. Ninety-nine percent of adult patients had invasive carcinoma compared with 64.8% of pediatric patients with the remaining patients having sarcoma, malignant phyllodes, or malignancy not otherwise specified (p &lt; 0.001). Pediatric patients were twice as likely to have an undifferentiated malignancy [relative risk (RR) 2.19; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72-3.79]. Half of adults presented with Stage I disease compared with only 22.7% of pediatric patients (p &lt; 0.001). Pediatric patients were 40% more likely to have positive axillary nodes (RR 1.42; 95% CI 1.10-1.84). Among patients with invasive carcinoma, pediatric patients were more than four times as likely to receive a bilateral than a unilateral mastectomy compared with adults (RR 4.56; 95% CI 3.19-6.53). There was no difference in overall survival between children and adults.CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric breast malignancies are more advanced at presentation, and there is variability in treatment practices. Adult and pediatric patients with invasive carcinoma have similar overall survival.	NA	0
28059831	Effect of dihydroartemisinin on UHRF1 gene expression in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.	As the second most common cancer in men around the world, prostate cancer is increasingly gaining more attention. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) has been proven to be a promising anticancer agent in vitro as well as in vivo in accumulating data. However, the detailed mechanisms of how DHA action in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate the effects of DHA, a novel anticancer agent, by inhibiting the expression of ubiquitin like containing PHD and ring finger 1 (UHRF1) in PC-3 cells. The apoptosis and cell-cycle distribution were detected by flow cytometry. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to examine both UHRF1 and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expressions at mRNA levels, whereas the expressions of UHRF1, DNMT1, and p16 proteins at protein levels were detected by Western blotting. Methylation levels of p16 CpG islands were determined by bisulfite genomic sequencing. We showed that DHA induced the downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1, accompanied by an upregulation of p16 in PC-3 cells. Decreased p16 promoter methylation levels in DHA-treated groups were also observed in PC-3 cells. Furthermore, DHA significantly induced apoptosis and G1/S cell-cycle arrest in PC-3 cells. Our results suggested that downregulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 is upstream to many cellular events, including G1 cell arrest, demethylation of p16, and apoptosis. Together, our study provides new evidence that DHA may serve as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of prostate cancer.	NA	0
28059830	2-Deoxy-D-glucose suppresses the migration and reverses the drug resistance of colon cancer cells through ADAM expression regulation.	Cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy is associated with a poor prognosis. The compound 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) enhances the effect of chemotherapy against cancer cells lines in vitro and in vivo. However, its effect on the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in drug-resistant cancer cells has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether treatment of 5-fluorouracil or oxaliplatin-resistant colorectal cancer (CRC) cells with 2-DG suppressed their migratory activity and enhanced their susceptibility to chemotherapy. Chemoresistant CRC cells stably expressed drug resistance-related proteins (MDR1, MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3) and showed mesenchymal characteristics and a migratory phenotype. 2-DG treatment attenuated glycolysis-related enzyme expression, invasion activity, and EMT-related cytokine secretion in drug-resistant CRC cells. In addition, 2-DG inhibited the activation of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) and ADAM17. Gene silencing of ADAM10 and ADAM17 with small interfering RNA downregulated mesenchymal properties, reduced EMT-associated cytokine secretion, and rendered chemoresistant cells susceptible to anticancer drug treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest that increased glycolytic metabolism in drug-resistant cells has an effect on both migratory activity and cell viability through the activation of ADAM10 and ADAM17.

28060419	A molecular roadmap of definitive erythropoiesis from human induced pluripotent stem cells.	Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are being considered for use in understanding haematopoietic disorders and as a potential source of in vitro manufactured red cells. Here, we show that hiPSCs are able to recapitulate various stages of developmental erythropoiesis. We show that primitive erythroblasts arise first, express CD31(+) with CD235a(+) , embryonic globins and red cell markers, but fail to express the hallmark red cell transcripts of adult erythropoiesis. When hiPSC-derived CD45(+) CD235a(-) haematopoietic progenitors are isolated on day 12 and further differentiated on OP9 stroma, they selectively express CD36(+) and CD235a(+) , adult erythroid transcripts for transcription factors (e.g., BCL11A, KLF1) and fetal/adult globins (HBG1/2, HBB). Importantly, hiPSC- and cord-derived CD36(+) CD235a(+) erythroblasts show a striking homology by transcriptome array profiling (only 306 transcripts with a 2Log fold change &gt;1·5- or 2·8-fold). Phenotypic and transcriptome profiling of CD45(+) CD117(+) CD235a(+) pro-erythroblasts and terminally differentiated erythroblasts is also provided, including evidence of a HbF (fetal) to HbA (adult) haemoglobin switch and enucleation, that mirrors their definitive erythroblast cord-derived counterparts. These findings provide a molecular roadmap of developmental erythropoiesis from hiPSC sources at several critical stages, but also helps to inform on their use for clinical applications and modelling human haematopoietic disease.

28057436	Comparison of Clinically Relevant Mutation Profiles Between Preoperative Biopsy and Corresponding Surgically Resected Specimens in Japanese Patients With Non-Small-cell Lung Cancer by Amplicon-based Massively Parallel Sequencing.	BACKGROUND: Amplicon-based massively parallel sequencing (MPS) is an effective platform for identifying clinically actionable mutations across many genes in limited amounts of tissue. Most lung cancers are diagnosed and staged using small tissue samples obtained by transbronchial biopsy (TBB). To determine whether the mutations in TBB specimens detected by amplicon-based MPS reflect those present in the tumors, we compared the mutational profiles of preoperative TBB specimens and corresponding surgically resected specimens.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fresh-frozen primary tumor specimens from non-small-cell lung cancer patients (n = 46) obtained preoperatively by TBB and during surgical resection were analyzed. The concordance of mutations detected by amplicon-based MPS in the 2 sample types was investigated, and the allele frequency of the mutations common to both specimens from the same patient was determined.RESULTS: An initial assessment of DNA quantity revealed that 46% of the TBB specimens (21 of 46) had less than the lower limit for amplicon-based MPS. These 21 TBB specimens were consequently omitted from the analysis. Of the 29 mutations detected in the TBB and/or surgically resected specimens from 25 patients, 23 were present in both samples, for a concordance rate of 79%.CONCLUSION: Amplicon-based MPS with TBB specimens approximately reflects clinically relevant tumor mutation profiles. However, the rate of TBB specimens with sufficient DNA quantity for amplicon-based MPS was only around 50%. Therefore, surgically resected specimens have a valuable role in exploratory and comprehensive genomic profiling.	NA	0
28056836	A significant cancer burden and high mortality of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in Thailand: a nationwide database study.	BACKGROUND: We aimed to examine the burden of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in Thailand and identify the prognostic factors for all-causes of death.METHODS: We conducted a population-based study of ICC patients admitted during 2009-2013 using the Nationwide Hospital Admission Database, the National Health Security Office (NHSO). There was an average of 1,051,146 patients/year with diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases (GI). All patients with a diagnosis of ICC (ICD10- C221) were included from a total of 72,479 admissions from 858 hospitals. The surgical resection procedures such as the radical pancreaticoduodenectomy, subtotal and partial hepatectomy were analyzed. Data for all patients were censored 1 year post-study or death, whichever came first.RESULTS: A total of 34,325 patients with ICC during a 5-year study period (on average, 6865 patients/year, with the incidence rate of 14.6 per 100,000 population, per year. The ICC patients had a mean age of 63.8+/-11.6 years and 63% were males. The mean length of hospital stay was 6.4+/-7.3 days with a mean+/-SD cost of hospitalization of $595+/-$1160 USD per admission. There were 659 patients (1.9%) underwent surgical resection. The overall survival of ICC patients with surgery was significantly better than those patients without surgery. Hazard ratio of death for patients without surgery was 2.5 (95% CI of 2.3-2.7). Approximately 14% of the ICC patients died during hospitalization. The median overall survival of all patients after the first admission was 53 +/-0.6 days. From the multivariate analysis, factors related to all-causes of death were: patients' age &gt;60 years (OR = 1.2, 95% CI; 1.1-1.3), length of hospital stay of &gt;7 days (OR = 1.1, 95% CI; 1.02-1.2), male (OR = 1.3, 95% CI; 1.2-1.4), living in the northern part of Thailand (OR = 1.5, 95% CI; 1.3-1.8) and presence of complications during admission (OR = 1.3, 95% CI; 1.1-1.5).CONCLUSION: The disease burden of patients with ICC in Thailand is significant with the incidence rate of 14.6 per 100,000 population, per year during 2009-2013 and showed high mortality rate of 14%.

28056823	Clinical significance of UGT1A1 polymorphism and expression of ERCC1, BRCA1, TYMS, RRM1, TUBB3, STMN1 and TOP2A in gastric cancer.	BACKGROUND: Individualized therapeutic regimen is a recently intensively pursued approach for targeting diseases, in which the search for biomarkers was considered the first and most important. Thus, the goal of this study was to investigate whether the UGT1A1, ERCC1, BRCA1, TYMS, RRM1, TUBB3, STMN1 and TOP2A genes are underlying biomarkers for gastric cancer, which, to our knowledge, has not been performed.METHODS: Ninety-eight tissue specimens were collected from gastric cancer patients between May 2012 and March 2015. A multiplex branched DNA liquidchip technology was used for measuring the mRNA expressions of ERCC1, BRCA1, TYMS, RRM1, TUBB3, STMN1 and TOP2A. Direct sequencing was performed for determination of UGT1A1 polymorphisms. Furthermore, correlations between gene expressions, polymorphisms and clinicopathological characteristics were investigated.RESULTS: The expressions of TYMS, TUBB3 and STMN1 were significantly associated with the clinicopathological characteristics of age, gender and family history of gastric cancer, but not with differentiation, growth patterns, metastasis and TNM staging in patients with gastric cancer. No clinical characteristics were correlated with the expressions of ERCC1, BRCA1, RRM1 and TOP2A. Additionally, patients carrying G allele at -211 of UGT1A1 were predisposed to developing tubular adenocarcinoma, while individuals carrying 6TAA or G allele respectively at *28 or -3156 of UGT1A1 tended to have a local invasion.CONCLUSIONS: The UGT1A1 polymorphism may be useful to screen the risk population of gastric cancer, while TYMS, TUBB3 and STMN1 may be potential biomarkers for prognosis and chemotherapy guidance.

28057743	IL21R expressing CD14+CD16+ monocytes expand in multiple myeloma patients leading to increased osteoclasts.	Bone marrow monocytes are primarily committed to osteoclast formation. It is, however, unknown whether potential primary alterations are specifically present in bone marrow monocytes of multiple myeloma patients, smoldering myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance. Herein, we analyzed the immunophenotypic and transcriptional profiles of bone marrow CD14+ monocytes in a cohort of patients with different types of monoclonal gammopathies to identify alterations involved in myeloma-enhanced osteoclastogenesis. A higher number of bone marrow CD14+CD16+ cells was found in patients with active myeloma as compared to those with smoldering myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance. Interestingly, sorted bone marrow CD14+CD16+ cells from myeloma patients were more pro-osteoclastogenic than CD14+CD16- cells in cultures ex vivo. Moreover, transcriptional analysis demonstrated that bone marrow multiple myeloma (but neither monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance nor smoldering myeloma) CD14+ cells significantly upregulated genes involved in osteoclast formation, including IL21R. IL21R mRNA over-expression by bone marrow CD14+ cells was independent from the presence of IL-21. Consistently, IL-21 production by T cells as well as IL-21 bone marrow levels were not significantly different among monoclonal gammopathies. Thereafter, we showed that IL21R over-expression in CD14+ cells increased osteoclast formation. Consistently, IL-21R signaling inhibition by Janex 1 suppressed osteoclast differentiation from bone marrow CD14+ cells of myeloma patients. Our results indicated that multiple myeloma patients showed distinct bone marrow monocyte features compared to those with indolent monoclonal gammopathies, supporting the role of IL21R over-expression by bone marrow CD14+ cells in enhanced osteoclast formation.

28057742	Dual role of IL-21 in megakaryopoiesis and platelet homeostasis.	Gene profiling studies have indicated that in vitro differentiated human megakaryocytes express the receptor for IL-21 (IL-21R), an immunostimulatory cytokine associated with inflammatory disorders and currently under evaluation in cancer therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether IL-21 modulates megakaryopoiesis. We first checked the expression of IL-21 receptor on human bone marrow and in vitro differentiated megakaryocytes. Then, we investigated the effect of IL-21 on the in vitro differentiation of human blood CD34+ progenitors into megakaryocytes. Finally, we analyzed the consequences of hydrodynamic transfection-mediated transient expression of IL-21, on megakaryopoieisis and thrombopoiesis in mice. The IL-21Rα chain was expressed in human bone marrow megakaryocytes and was progressively induced during in vitro differentiation of human peripheral CD34+ progenitors, while the signal transducing γ chain was down-regulated. Consistently, the STAT3 phosphorylation induced by IL-21 diminished during the later stages of megakaryocytic differentiation. In vitro, IL-21 increased the number of CFU-MKs generated from CD34+ cells and the number of megakaryocyte differentiated from CD34+ progenitors in a JAK3- and STAT3-dependent manner. Forced expression of IL-21 in mice increased the density of bi-potent MK progenitors and bone marrow megakaryocytes, and the platelet generation, but increased platelet clearance and consequently resulting in reduced blood platelet counts. Our work suggests that IL-21 regulates megakaryocyte development and platelet homeostasis. Thus IL-21 may link immune responses to physiological or pathological platelet-dependent processes.	NA	0
28057739	Aberrant Let7a/HMGA2 signaling activity with unique clinical phenotype in JAK2-mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms.	High mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) is an architectural transcriptional factor that is negatively regulated by Let-7 microRNA through binding to its 3-untranslated region (3-UTR). Transgenic mice expressing HMGA2 with a truncation of its 3-UTR has been shown to exhibit a myeloproliferative phenotype. To decipher the Let-7-HMGA2 axis in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), we employed an in vitro model supplemented with clinical correlation. Ba/F3 cells with inducible JAK2V617F expression (Ton.JAK2.V617F cells) showed up-regulation of HMGA2 with concurrent let-7a repression. Ton.JAK2.V617F cells treated with a let-7a inhibitor exhibited further escalation of HMGA2 expression, while a let-7a mimic diminished the HMGA2 transcript level. HMGA2 overexpression conferred JAK2-mutated cells a survival advantage through inhibited apoptosis. Pan-JAK inhibitor INC424 increased the expression of let-7a, down-regulated the level of HMGA2, and led to increased apoptosis in Ton.JAK2.V617F cells in a dose-dependent manner. In samples from 151 patients with MPN, there was a modest invest correlation between the expression levels of let-7a and HMGA2. Overexpression of HMGA2 was detected in 29 (19.2%) of the cases, and it was more commonly seen in patients with essential thrombocythemia than in those with polycythemia vera (26.9% vs. 12.7%, p = 0.044). MPN patients harboring up-regulated HMGA2 showed in increased propensity of developing major thrombotic events, and they were more likely to harbor one of the 3 driver mutations. Our findings suggest that, in a subset of MPN patients, Let-7-HMGA2 axis plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of the disease that leads to unique clinical phenotypes.	NA	0
28061021	Comprehensive assessment of tumour budding on cytokeratin stains in colorectal cancer.	BACKGROUND: Tumour budding in colorectal cancer (CRC) is a recognized prognostic parameter. Aim of this study is to address the use of cytokeratin immunostaining for visualization and scoring of tumour buds.METHODS: Ten hotspots (0.238 mm(2) ) of peritumoural (PTB) and intratumoural (ITB) budding were evaluated in surgical resections from 215 patients. The budding counts in the 10 densest regions anywhere in the tumour were combined into an overall tumour budding (OTB) score. The PTB, ITB and OTB hotspot with the maximum budding count was then evaluated. Finally, continuous and cut-off values of 10 buds/HPF (PTB10HPF ), 5 buds/HPF (ITB10HPF ) and 8 buds/HPF (OTB10HPF ) were used to categorize budding counts into low/high-grade scores.RESULTS: All budding scores were highly correlated. PTB and ITB counts were associated with many clinicopathological features including tumour stage, lymph node and distant metastasis, venous and lymphovascular invasion and disease-free survival (DFS) (all p&lt;0.05). Analyses of OTB counts recapitulated these associations, including a lower DFS with a greater number of tumour buds (p=0.0309; HR (95%CI): 1.032 (1.003-1.062)). One OTB hotspot performed similarly as ten OTB hotspots in terms of relationship with outcome. These statistical significances were largely lost when cut-offs were applied to PTB, ITB or OTB counts.CONCLUSIONS: OTB count in a single hotspot on cytokeratin-stained CRC tissue sections is a fast and reliable prognostic scoring system for the assessment of tumour budding. This approach should be considered in future studies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	NA	0
28057758	Down-Regulation of Claudin-2 Expression and Proliferation by Epigenetic Inhibitors in Human Lung Adenocarcinoma A549 Cells.	Claudin-2 is highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and increases proliferation in adenocarcinoma cells. The chemicals which reduce claudin-2 expression may have anti-cancer effect, but such therapeutic medicines have not been developed. We found that azacitidine (AZA), a DNA methylation inhibitor, and trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (NaB), histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, decrease claudin-2 levels. The effect of AZA was mediated by the inhibition of phosphorylated Akt and NFκB. LY-294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K), and BAY 11-7082, an NF-κB inhibitor, decreased claudin-2 levels. The reporter activity of claudin-2 was decreased by AZA and LY-294002, which was blocked by the mutation in a putative NF-κB binding site. NF-κ;B bound to the promoter region of claudin-2, which was inhibited by AZA and LY-294002. AZA is suggested to decrease claudin-2 mRNA level mediated by the inhibition of a PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway. TSA and NaB did not change phosphorylated Akt and NF-κB levels. Furthermore, these inhibitors did not change the reporter activity of claudin-2, but decreased the stability of claudin-2 mRNA mediated by the elevation of miR-497 microRNA. The binding of histone H3 to the promoter region of miR-497 was inhibited by TSA and NaB, whereas that of claudin-2 was not. These results suggest that HDAC inhibitors decrease claudin-2 levels mediated by the elevation of miR-497 expression. Cell proliferation was additively decreased by AZA, TSA and NaB, which was partially rescued by ectopic expression of claudin-2. We suggest that epigenetic inhibitors suppress the abnormal proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cells highly expressing claudin-2.	NA	0
28059167	Splicing imbalances in basal-like breast cancer underpin perturbation of cell surface and oncogenic pathways and are associated with patients' survival.	Despite advancements in the use of transcriptional information to understand and classify breast cancers, the contribution of splicing to the establishment and progression of these tumours has only recently starting to emerge. Our work explores this lesser known landscape, with special focus on the basal-like breast cancer subtype where limited therapeutic opportunities and no prognostic biomarkers are currently available. Using ExonArray analysis of 176 breast cancers and 9 normal breast tissues we demonstrate that splicing levels significantly contribute to the diversity of breast cancer molecular subtypes and explain much of the differences compared with normal tissues. We identified pathways specifically affected by splicing imbalances whose perturbation would be hidden from a conventional gene-centric analysis of gene expression. We found that a large fraction of them involve cell-to-cell communication, extracellular matrix and transport, as well as oncogenic and immune-related pathways transduced by plasma membrane receptors. We identified 247 genes in which splicing imbalances are associated with clinical patients' outcome, whilst no association was detectable at the gene expression level. These include the signaling gene TGFBR1, the proto-oncogene MYB as well as many immune-related genes such as CCR7 and FCRL3, reinforcing evidence for a role of immune components in influencing breast cancer patients' prognosis.

28059163	Phosphoproteomic comparison of Pik3ca and Pten signalling identifies the nucleotidase NT5C as a novel AKT substrate.	To identify novel effectors and processes regulated by PI3K pathway activation, we performed an unbiased phosphoproteomic screen comparing two common events of PI3K deregulation in cancer: oncogenic Pik3ca mutation (Pik3ca(H1047R)) and deletion of Pten. Using mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) models that generate inducible, low-level pathway activation as observed in cancer, we quantified 7566 unique phosphopeptides from 3279 proteins. A number of proteins were found to be differentially-regulated by Pik3ca(H1047R) and Pten loss, suggesting unique roles for these two events in processes such as vesicular trafficking, DNA damage repair and RNA splicing. We also identified novel PI3K effectors that were commonly-regulated, including putative AKT substrates. Validation of one of these hits, confirmed NT5C (5',3'-Nucleotidase, Cytosolic) as a novel AKT substrate, with an unexpected role in actin cytoskeleton regulation via an interaction with the ARP2/3 complex. This study has produced a comprehensive data resource and identified a new link between PI3K pathway activation and actin regulation.	NA	0
28059154	ABCG2-overexpressing H460/MX20 cell xenografts in athymic nude mice maintained original biochemical and cytological characteristics.	H460/MX20 are derived from large cell lung cancer H460 cell line and then transformed into ABCG2-overexpressing cells by mitoxantrone's induction, which are widely used in study of multidrug resistance (MDR) in vitro. To establish and spread the model of H460/MX20 cell xenografts, we investigated whether cell biological characteristics and the MDR phenotype were maintained in vivo model. Our results demonstrated that the cell proliferation, cell cycle, and ABCG2 expression level in xH460/MX20 cells isolated from H460/MX20 cell xenografts were similar to H460/MX20 cells in vitro. Importantly, xH460/MX20 cells exhibited high levels of resistance to ABCG2 substrates such as mitoxantrone and topotecan as H460/MX20 cells did. Furthermore, lapatinib, the inhibitor of ABCG2, potently reversed mitoxantrone- and topotecan-resistance of xH460/MX20 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that H460/MX20 cell xenografts in athymic nude mice still retain their original cytological characteristics and MDR phenotype. Thus, the H460/MX20 cell xenografts model could serve as a sound model in vivo for study on reversal MDR.	NA	0
28059107	Single cell time-lapse analysis reveals that podoplanin enhances cell survival and colony formation capacity of squamous cell carcinoma cells.	Tumor initiating cells (TICs) are characterized by high clonal expansion capacity. We previously reported that podoplanin is a TIC-specific marker for the human squamous cell carcinoma cell line A431. The aim of this study is to explore the molecular mechanism underlying the high clonal expansion potential of podoplanin-positive A431cells using Fucci imaging. Single podoplanin-positive cells created large colonies at a significantly higher frequency than single podoplanin-negative cells, whereas no difference was observed between the two types of cells with respect to cell cycle status. Conversely, the cell death ratio of progenies derived from podoplanin-positive single cell was significantly lower than that of cells derived from podoplanin-negative cells. Single A431 cells, whose podoplanin expression was suppressed by RNA interference, exhibited increased cell death ratios and decreased frequency of large colony forming. Moreover, the frequency of large colony forming decreased significantly when podoplanin-positive single cells was treated with a ROCK (Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase) inhibitor, whereas no difference was observed in single podoplanin-negative cells. Our current study cleared that high clonal expansion capacity of podoplanin-positive TICs populations was the result of reduced cell death by podoplanin-mediated signaling. Therefore, podoplanin activity may be a therapeutic target in the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas.	NA	0
28059085	Hampering Effect of Cholesterol on the Permeation of Reactive Oxygen Species through Phospholipids Bilayer: Possible Explanation for Plasma Cancer Selectivity.	In recent years, the ability of cold atmospheric pressure plasmas (CAPS) to selectively induce cell death in cancer cells has been widely established. This selectivity has been assigned to the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) created in CAPs. To provide new insights in the search for an explanation for the observed selectivity, we calculate the transfer free energy of multiple ROS across membranes containing a varying amount of cholesterol. The cholesterol fraction is investigated as a selectivity parameter because membranes of cancer cells are known to contain lower fractions of cholesterol compared to healthy cells. We find that cholesterol has a significant effect on the permeation of reactive species across a membrane. Indeed, depending on the specific reactive species, an increasing cholesterol fraction can lead to (i) an increase of the transfer free energy barrier height and width, (ii) the formation of a local free energy minimum in the center of the membrane and (iii) the creation of extra free energy barriers due to the bulky sterol rings. In the context of plasma oncology, these observations suggest that the increased ingress of RONS in cancer cells can be explained by the decreased cholesterol fraction of their cell membrane.	NA	0
28059079	TRIM14 is a Putative Tumor Suppressor and Regulator of Innate Immune Response in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.	Non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of malignant lung tumors and is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Our group previously identified Tripartite Motif 14 (TRIM14) as a component of a prognostic multigene expression signature for NSCLC. Little is known about the function of TRIM14 protein in normal or disease states. We investigated the functional and prognostic role of TRIM14 in NSCLC using in vitro and in vivo perturbation model systems. Firstly, a pooled RNAi screen identified TRIM14 to effect cell proliferation/survival in NSCLC cells. Secondly, silencing of TRIM14 expression significantly enhanced tumor growth in NSCLC xenograft mouse models, while exogenous TRIM14 expression attenuated tumorigenesis. In addition, differences in apoptotic activity between TRIM14-deficient and control tumors suggests that TRIM14 tumor suppressor activity may depend on cell death signaling pathways. TRIM14-deficient cell lines showed both resistance to hypoxia-induced cell death and attenuation of interferon response via STAT1 signaling. Consistent with these phenotypes, multivariate analyses on published mRNA expression datasets of over 600 primary NSCLCs demonstrated that low TRIM14 mRNA levels are significantly associated with poorer prognosis in early stage NSCLC patients. Our functional data therefore establish a novel tumor suppressive role for TRIM14 in NSCLC progression.	prognostic	1
28057486	MiR-221-3p targets ARF4 and inhibits the proliferation and migration of epithelial ovarian cancer cells.	Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic cancer. Although molecular diagnostic tools and targeted therapies have been developed over the past few decades, the survival rate is still rather low. Numerous researches suggest that some microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of tumor progression. Among those miRNAs that has attracted much attention for their multiple roles in human cancers, the function of miR-221-3p in EOC has not been elucidated. Herein, we examined the expression of miR-221-3p in EOC patients and cell lines. Our data revealed that higher expression of miR-221-3p was linked to better overall survival in EOC patients. In-vitro experiments indicated that miR-221-3p inhibited EOC cell proliferation and migration. By performing subsequent systematic molecular biological and bioinformatic analyses, we found ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) 4 is one of the putative target genes, the direct binding relationship was further confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Finally, a distinct gene expression between miR-221-3p and ARF4 in EOC group and normal group was identified, and the negative correlation between their expression levels in EOC specimens was further confirmed. Taken together, our research uncovered the tumor suppressive role of miR-221-3p in EOC and directly targeted ARF4, suggesting that miR-221-3p might be a novel potential candidate for clinical prognosis and therapeutics of EOC.

28058814	Overexpression of TNKS1BP1 in lung cancers and its involvement in homologous recombination pathway of DNA double-strand breaks.	TNKS1BP1 is a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) superfamily. Our previous studies have demonstrated that TNKS1BP1 plays an important role in DNA damage response. But whether and how TNKS1BP1 associates with cancer is still not clear. Here, we found that TNKS1BP1 was upregulated in human lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) tissues, and was associated with poor overall survival (OS) in LAC patients. Dysregulation of TNKS1BP1 affected the sensitivity of A549 cells to several DNA damage agents including cisplatin, bleomycin, and ionizing radiation. Mechanically, overexpression of TNKS1BP1 increased the accumulation of S phase cells, which was accompanied by a decrease in M phase cells. More importantly, we found TNKS1BP1 regulated genome stability, mainly through affecting the homologous recombination pathway of DNA double-strand breaks by inhibiting the RAD51 foci formation. Overall, our study indicates that, in LAC, aberrant expressions of TNKS1BP1 are common events, and overexpression of TNKS1BP1 might affect outcomes of cancer patients to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

28058502	A novel loss-of-function heterozygous BRCA2 c.8946_8947delAG mutation found in a Chinese woman with family history of breast cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the most frequent female malignancy worldwide. Among them, some cases have hereditary susceptibility in two leading genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Heterozygous germ line mutations in them are related with increased risk of breast, ovarian and other cancer, following autosomal dominant inheritance mode.METHODS AND RESULTS: For purpose of early finding, early diagnosis and early treatment, mutation detecting of BRCA1/2 genes was performed in unselected 300 breast or ovarian patients and unaffected women using next-generation sequencing and then confirmed by Sanger sequencing. A non-previously reported heterozygous mutation c.8946_8947delAG (p.D2983FfsX34) of BRCA2 gene was identified in an unaffected Chinese woman with family history of breast cancer (her breast cancer mother, also carrying this mutation). The BRCA2-truncated protein resulted from the frame shift mutation was found to lose two putative nuclear localization signals and a Rad51-binding motif in the extreme C-terminal region by bioinformatic prediction. And then in vitro experiments showed that nearly all the mutant protein was unable to translocate to the nucleus to perform DNA repair activity. This novel mutant BRCA2 protein is dysfunction.CONCLUSIONS: We classify the mutation into disease causing and conclude that it is the risk factor for breast cancer in this family. So, conducting the same mutation test and providing genetic counseling for this family is practically meaningful and significant. Meanwhile, the identification of this new mutation enriches the Breast Cancer Information Core database, especially in China.	NA	2
28057026	Advances in rare cell isolation: an optimization and evaluation study.	BACKGROUND: Rare nucleated CD45 negative cells in peripheral blood may be malignant such as circulating tumor cells. Untouched isolation thereof by depletion of normal is favored yet still technological challenging. We optimized and evaluated a novel magnetic bead-based negative selection approach for enhanced enrichment of rare peripheral blood nucleated CD45 negative cells and investigated the problem of rare cell contamination during phlebotomy.METHODS: Firstly, the performance of the magnetic cell separation system was assessed using leukocytes and cultivated fibroblast cells in regard to depletion efficiency and the loss of cells of interest. Secondly, a negative selection assay was optimized for high performance, simplicity and cost efficiency. The negative selection assay consisted of; a RBC lysis step, two depletion cycles comprising direct magnetically labelling of leukocytes using anti-CD45 magnetic beads followed by magnetic capture of leukocytes using a duopole permanent magnet. Thirdly, assay evaluation was aligned to conditions of rare cell frequencies and comprised cell spike recovery, cell viability and proliferation, and CD45 negative cell detection. Additionally, the problem of CD45 negative cell contamination during phlebotomy was investigated.RESULTS: The depletion factor and recovery of the negative selection assay measured at most 1600-fold and 96%, respectively, leaving at best 1.5 × 10(4) leukocytes unseparated and took 35 min. The cell viability was negatively affected by chemical RBC lysis. Proliferation of 100 spiked ovarian cancer cells in culture measured 37% against a positive control. Healthy donor testing revealed findings of nucleated CD45 negative cells ranging from 1 to 22 cells /2.5 × 10(7) leukocytes or 3.5 mL whole blood in 89% (23/26) of the samples.CONCLUSION: Our assay facilitates high performance at shortest assay time. The enrichment assay itself causes minor harm to cells and allows proliferation. Our findings suggest that rare cell contamination is unavoidable. An unexpected high variety of CD45 negative cells have been detected. It is hypothesized that a rare cell profile may translate into tumor marker independent screening.	NA	0
28060055	Genetic counselling and high-penetrance susceptibility gene analysis reveal the novel CDKN2A p.D84V (c.251A&gt;T) mutation in melanoma-prone families from Italy.	Genetic susceptibility to primary cutaneous melanoma (PCM) may account for up to 12% of PCMs, presenting as the familial atypical mole/multiple melanoma syndrome (FAMMM), an autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, characterized by PCM in at least two relatives and/or more than one PCMs in the same patient. To identify individuals at high genetic risk of PCM, from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2015, we offered genetic counselling and molecular analysis of the two high-penetrance FAMMM susceptibility genes, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), to 92 consecutive, unrelated patients with FAMMM. Age at diagnosis and number of PCMs were obtained from medical records; the number of PCMs and affected relatives were recorded for each family. The diagnostic work-up consisted of genetic counselling and cascade genetic testing in patients and further extension to relatives of those identified as mutation carriers. All exons and exon/intron boundaries of CDKN2A and CDK4 genes were screened by direct bidirectional sequencing. We identified CDKN2A mutations in 19 of the 92 unrelated patients (20.6%) and in 14 additional, clinically healthy relatives. Eleven of these latter subsequently underwent excision of dysplastic nevi, but none developed PCM during a median follow-up of 37.3 months. In three patients from unrelated families, the novel CDKN2A p.D84V (c.251A&gt;T) mutation was observed, associated with PCM in each pedigree. Genetic screening of FAMMM patients and their relatives can contribute towards specific primary and secondary prevention programmes for individuals at high genetic risk of PCM. The novel CDKN2A p.D84V (c.251A&gt;T) mutation adds to the known mutations associated with FAMMM.	NA	2
28057046	Prognostic role of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: The presence of a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been associated with increased mortality in several malignancies. Here, we quantify the effect of NLR on survival in patients with breast cancer, and examine the effect of clinicopathologic factors on its prognostic value.METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted to identify publications exploring the association of blood NLR (measured pre treatment) and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) among patients with breast cancer. Data from studies reporting a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) or a P value were pooled in a meta-analysis. Pooled HRs were computed and weighted using generic inverse variance. Meta-regression was performed to evaluate the influence of clinicopathologic factors such as age, disease stage, tumor grade, nodal involvement, receptor status, and NLR cutoff on the HR for OS and DFS. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: Fifteen studies comprising a total of 8563 patients were included. The studies used different cutoff values to classify high NLR (range 1.9-5.0). The median cutoff value for high NLR used in these studies was 3.0 amongst 13 studies reporting a HR for OS, and 2.5 in 10 studies reporting DFS outcomes. NLR greater than the cutoff value was associated with worse OS (HR 2.56, 95% CI = 1.96-3.35; P &lt; 0.001) and DFS (HR 1.74, 95% CI = 1.47-2.07; P &lt; 0.001). This association was similar in studies including only early-stage disease and those comprising patients with both early-stage and metastatic disease. Estrogen receptor (ER) and HER-2 appeared to modify the effect of NLR on DFS, because NLR had greater prognostic value for DFS in ER-negative and HER2-negative breast cancer. No subgroup showed an influence on the association between NLR and OS.CONCLUSIONS: High NLR is associated with an adverse OS and DFS in patients with breast cancer with a greater effect on disease-specific outcome in ER and HER2-negative disease. NLR is an easily accessible prognostic marker, and its addition to established risk prediction models warrants further investigation.	NA	0
28057031	NA	BACKGROUND: This study investigated the value of some clinicopathological parameters and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)FDG-PET/CT) indices, including textural features, to predict event-free survival (EFS) in estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) locally advanced breast cancer (BC) patients.METHODS: FDG-PET/CT indices and clinicopathological parameters were assessed before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). After completion of chemotherapy, all patients had breast surgery with axillary lymph node dissection, followed by radiation therapy and endocrine therapy for 5 years. EFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for multivariate analysis.RESULTS: One hundred forty-three consecutive patients with stage II-III ER+/HER2- BC and without distant metastases at baseline PET were included. High standardized uptake values (SUVs), were associated with shorter EFS (HR = 3.51, P &lt; 0.01 for SUVmax; HR = 2.76, P = 0.02 for SUVmean; and HR = 4.40 P &lt; 0.01 for SUVpeak). Metabolically active tumor volume (MATV, HR = 3.47, P &lt; 0.01) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG, HR = 3.10, P &lt; 0.01) were also predictive of EFS. Homogeneity was not predictive (HR = 2.27, P = 0.07) and entropy had weak prediction (HR = 2.89, P = 0.02). Among clinicopathological parameters, EFS was shorter in progesterone receptor (PR)-negative tumor (vs. PR-positive tumor; HR = 3.25, P &lt; 0.01); histology was predictive of EFS (lobular vs. ductal invasive carcinoma; HR = 3.74, P = 0.01) but not tumor grade (grade 3 vs. grade 1-2; HR = 1.64, P = 0.32). Pathological complete response after NAC was not correlated to the risk of relapse. Three parameters remained significantly associated with EFS in multivariate analysis. MATV (HR = 1.01, P &lt; 0.01), progesterone receptor expression (HR = 2.90, P = 0.03) and tumor histology (HR = 3.80, P = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: Baseline PET parameters measured before neoadjuvant treatment have prognostic values in ER+/HER2- locally advanced breast cancer patients. After multivariate analysis, metabolically active tumor volume remains significant while textural analysis of PET images is not of added value. Considering histopathological parameters, our study shows that patients with PR-negative or lobular invasive tumor have poorer prognosis than patients with PR-positive or ductal carcinoma, respectively.

28058701	Correlation between chromosome 9p21 locus deletion and prognosis in clinically localized prostate cancer.	BACKGROUND: Some studies have reported that deletions at chromosome arm 9p occur frequently and represent a critical step in carcinogenesis of some neoplasms. Our aim was to evaluate the deletion of locus 9p21 and chromosomes 3, 7 and 17 in localized prostate cancer (PC) and correlate these alterations with prognostic factors and biochemical recurrence after surgery.METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated surgical specimens from 111 patients with localized PC who underwent radical prostatectomy. Biochemical recurrence was defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) &amp;gt;0.2 ng/mL and the mean postoperative follow-up was 123 months. The deletions were evaluated using fluorescence in situ hybridization with centromeric and locus-specific probes in a tissue microarray containing 2 samples from each patient. We correlated the occurrence of any deletion with pathological stage, Gleason score, ISUP grade group, PSA and biochemical recurrence.RESULTS: We observed a loss of any probe in only 8 patients (7.2%). The most common deletion was the loss of locus 9p21, which occurred in 6.4% of cases. Deletions of chromosomes 3, 7 and 17 were observed in 2.3%, 1.2% and 1.8% patients, respectively. There was no correlation between chromosome loss and Gleason score, ISUP, PSA or stage. Biochemical recurrence occurred in 83% cases involving 9p21 deletions. Loss of 9p21 locus was significantly associated with time to recurrence (p = 0.038).CONCLUSIONS: We found low rates of deletion in chromosomes 3, 7 and 17 and 9p21 locus. We observed that 9p21 locus deletion was associated with worse prognosis in localized PC treated by radical prostatectomy.	NA	2
28058700	XRCC1 Arg399Gln gene polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma risk in the Italian population.	BACKGROUND: The human X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1 (XRCC1) gene encodes for one of the major repair factors involved in base excision repair (BER), which is reported to be associated with the risk of several cancers. A few studies have explored the association between risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in different DNA repair genes, with contradictory results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism and susceptibility to HCC.METHODS: A total of 89 HCC patients and 99 randomly selected healthy controls were enrolled. Genotyping of XRCC1 rs25487 was performed by high-resolution melting analysis and Sanger sequencing.RESULTS: On univariate analysis, a statistically significant association was found between risk of HCC and XRCC1 399Arg/Gln genotype (odd ratio [OR] = 1.88; 95% CI, 1.04-3.43), which was confirmed after adjusting by sex (OR = 1.94; 95% CI, 1.04-3.63). Although not significant, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a decreased median survival in Arg/Gln genotype carriers in comparison with Arg/Arg carriers.CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting an association between BER SNP and HCC risk in a population of central-southern Italy.

28057028	Oleuropein enhances radiation sensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma by downregulating PDRG1 through HIF1α-repressed microRNA-519d.	BACKGROUND: Oleuropein (OL) is a well-known anti-oxidative agent and is shown to reduce the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF1α) protein expression after radiation. The current study investigated the effects of OL on radiation response in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).METHODS: Colony formation assay was performed to compare the radiation response in vitro. Xenograft mouse model was used to study the OL effects on radiation in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays were performed to identify the relations among HIF1α, miR-519d and PDRG1. Stable HIF1α or PDRG1 overexpression, and miR-519d downregulation were performed to test the radiation response both in vitro and in vivo.RESULTS: OL strongly enhanced radiosensitivity of NPC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays suggested miR-519d was a direct target of HIF1α, and PDRG1 was a direct target of miR-519d. Overexpression of HIF1α or PDRG1, and downregulation of miR-519d abolished the radiation sensitizing effects of OL.CONCLUSION: Our study hereby demonstrates OL is a radiation sensitizing agent in NPC both in vivo and in vitro. OL treatment reduces the activity of HIF1α-miR-519d-PDRG1 pathway, which is essential to the radiosensitizing effects of OL.	NA	0
28057025	Nomogram integrating gene expression signatures with clinicopathological features to predict survival in operable NSCLC: a pooled analysis of 2164 patients.	BACKGROUND: The current tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system is insufficient to predict outcome of patients with operable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) owing to its phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity. Integrating genomic signatures with clinicopathological factors may provide more detailed evaluation of prognosis.METHODS: All 2164 clinically annotated NSCLC samples (1326 in the training set and 838 in the validation set) with corresponding microarray data from 17 cohorts were pooled to develop and validate a clinicopathologic-genomic nomogram based on Cox regression model. Two computational methods were applied to these samples to capture expression pattern of genomic signatures representing biological statuses. Model performance was measured by the concordance index (C-index) and calibration plot. Risk group stratification was proposed for the nomogram.RESULTS: Multivariable analysis of the training set identified independent factors including age, TNM stage, combined prognostic classifier, non-overlapping signature, and the ratio of neutrophil to plasma cells. The C-index of the nomogram for predicting survival was statistically superior to that of the TNM stage (training set, 0.686 vs 0.627, respectively; P &lt; .001; validation set, 0.689 vs 0.638, respectively; P &lt; .001). The calibration plots showed that the predicted 1-, 3- and 5-year survival probabilities agreed well with the actual observations. Stratifying patients into three risk groups detected significant differences among survival curves.CONCLUSIONS: These findings offer preliminary evidence that genomic data provide independent and complementary prognostic information and incorporation of this information can refine prognosis in NSCLC. Prospective studies are required to further explore the value of this composite model for prognostic stratification and tailored therapeutic strategies.	NA	0
28057020	RNA virus receptor Rig-I monitors gut microbiota and inhibits colitis-associated colorectal cancer.	BACKGROUND: Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (Rig-I) is an intracellular viral RNA receptor, which specifically recognizes double-stranded viral RNA initiating antiviral innate immunity. Increasing evidences showed that Rig-I had broader roles in antibacterial immunity and cancer protection. However, the potential roles and mechanisms of Rig-I in gut flora regulation and colorectal cancer (CRC) progression remain unclear.METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect Rig-I protein in 38 pairs of CRC tissue and matched adjacent mucosa, and immunofluorescence and western blot were also used to detect Rig-I protein expression in AOM/DSS-induced mice CRC samples. High-throughput sequencing was conducted to evaluate gut microbiota changes in Rig-I-deficient mice. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were used to detect IgA expression. Additionally, real-time quantitative PCR was performed to detect RNA expression in mouse intestines and cultured cells, and western blot was used to detect phosphorylation of STAT3 in IL-6-stimulated B cell line.RESULTS: Rig-I was downregulated in human and mouse CRC samples and Rig-I-deficient mice were more susceptible to AOM/DSS-induced colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Furthermore, Rig-I-deficient mice displayed gut microbiota disturbance compared to wild type mice. IgA, Reg3γ and Pdcd1 levels were decreased in intestines of Rig-I-deficient mice. Phosphorylation of STAT3 in IL-6-stimulated 1B4B6 was decreased.CONCLUSION: Rig-I could regulate gut microbiota through regulating IgA and IL6-STAT3-dependent Reg3γ expression. Besides, Rig-I could inhibit CRC progression.	NA	0
28057015	Downregulation of long noncoding RNA MEG3 is associated with poor prognosis and promoter hypermethylation in cervical cancer.	BACKGROUND: Our previous study reported that MEG3 is an important tumor suppressor gene that is inactivated in cervical cancer. However, the diagnostic and prognostic values of MEG3, as well as the molecular mechanism of MEG3 inactivation in cervical cancer, remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to further elucidate the role and potential inactivation mechanism of MEG3 in cervical cancer.METHODS: ROC curve and Cox regression analyses were used to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of MEG3 in patients with cervical cancer. The methylation status of the MEG3 promoter in cervical cancer tissue samples was tested using methylation-specific PCR. Furthermore, we altered the methylation status of the MEG3 promoter in two cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa and CaSki) using a DNA methylation transfer enzyme inhibitor (5-Aza-CdR), to investigate whether promoter hypermethylation is a potential cause of MEG3 inactivation. Finally, we used CCK-8 and colony formation assays to evaluate the cell proliferation ability of HeLa and CaSki cells that had been treated with 5-aza-CdR, to investigate whether downregulation of MEG3 caused by promoter hypermethylation had biological effects.RESULTS: ROC curve analysis indicated that MEG3 status showed sufficient sensitivity and specificity for prediction of tumor size and lymph node metastasis in patients with cervical cancer. In addition, our follow-up data showed that low MEG3 expression was correlated with recurrence and short overall survival. Moreover, hypermethylation of the MEG3 promoter was observed in most cervical cancer tissue samples, and demethylation of the MEG3 promoter led to re-expression of MEG3 and inhibited proliferation of HeLa and CaSki cells.CONCLUSIONS: MEG3 is a powerful tool for diagnosis and prognosis of patients with cervical cancer, and low expression of MEG3 is likely to be related to promoter hypermethylation in cervical cancer.

28059478	Amplified 7q21-22 gene MCM7 and its intronic miR-25 suppress COL1A2 associated genes to sustain intestinal gastric cancer features.	Frequent amplification of 7q21-22 genomic region is known in gastric cancer. Multiple genes including SHFM1, MCM7 and COL1A2 were reported to be the potential cancer candidate genes of this 20 Mb amplicon. This amplicon has two polycistrionic miRNA clusters and in the present study, miR-106b-25 cluster located in intron-13 of MCM7 was identified to express in gastric tumors. Among the 7q21-22 candidate genes, SHFM1 &amp; MCM7 are expressed in intestinal type gastric tumors, whereas COL1A2 is expressed in diffuse type gastric tumors. Across gastric tumors, miR-25 was identified to co-express with MCM7 and SHFM1. On the other hand, negative correlation was observed between miR-25 and COL1A2 expression. miR-25 originating from MCM7 was found capable of selectively targeting the adjacent gene COL1A2. Silencing of miR-25 was found capable of elevating the expression of COL1A2 and inhibiting E-cadherin expression, revealing the diffuse type gastric cancer suppressive role conferred by miR-25. miR-25 was also found to suppress p53, and activate c-Src revealing its intestinal type gastric cancer associated oncogenic functions. Genome-wide expression profiling upon miR-25 silencing reveals that miR-25 is capable of suppressing 40 genes which are co-expressed with COL1A2, involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis which are the typical diffuse type gastric cancer features. The results clearly demonstrate 7q21-22 amplification, MCM7 and its intronic miR-25 are the major molecular switches involved in the complex oncogenic circuits of gastric cancer.

28059468	Gene Expression Analysis Combined with Functional Genomics Approach Identifies ITIH5 as Tumor Suppressor Gene in Cervical Carcinogenesis.	Progression from human papillomavirus-induced premalignant cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to cervical cancer (CC) is driven by genetic and epigenetic events. Our microarray-based expression study has previously shown that inter-α-trypsin-inhibitor heavy chain 5 (ITIH5) mRNA levels in CCs were significantly lower than in high-grade precursor lesions (CIN3s). Therefore, we aimed to analyze in depth ITIH5 expression during cervical carcinogenesis in biopsy material and cell culture. Moreover, functional analyses were performed by ectopic expression of ITIH5 in different cell lines. We were able to confirm the validity of our microarray differential expression data by qPCR, demonstrating a clear ITIH5 downregulation in CC as compared with CIN2/3 or normal cervix. ITIH5 protein loss, evaluated by immunohistochemistry, was evident in 81% of CCs, whereas ITIH5 showed weak to moderate cytoplasmic staining in 91% of CIN2/3 cases. In addition, ITIH5 was strongly reduced or absent in seven CC cell lines and in three immortalized keratinocyte cell lines. Moreover, ITIH5 mRNA loss was associated with ITIH5 promoter methylation. ITIH5 expression could be restored in CC cell lines by pharmacological induction of DNA demethylation and histone acetylation. Functionally, ITIH5 overexpression significantly suppressed proliferation of SW756 cells and further resulted in a significant reduction of colony formation and cell migration in both CaSki and SW756 tumor models, but had no effect on invasion. Remarkably, ITIH5 overexpression did not influence the phenotype of HeLa cells. Taken together, ITIH5 gene silencing is a frequent event during disease progression, thereby providing evidence for a tumor suppressive role in cervical carcinogenesis.

28057329	Hyperfractionated accelerated reirradiation for rectal cancer: An analysis of outcomes and toxicity.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate outcomes and toxicity in patients treated with hyperfractionated pelvic reirradiation for recurrent rectal cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: 102 patients with recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma were treated with pelvic reirradiation with a hyperfractionated accelerated approach, consisting of 1.5Gy twice daily fractions to a total dose of 30-45Gy (median 39Gy), with the most common total dose 39Gy (n=90, 88%). The median dose of prior pelvic radiation therapy (RT) was 50.4Gy (range: 25-63Gy).RESULTS: The median follow-up was 40months for living patients (range, 3-150months). The 3-year freedom from local progression (FFLP) rate was 40% and the 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 39%. Treatment with surgery was significantly associated with improved FFLP and OS, with 3-year FFLP rate of 49% vs. 30% (P=0.013), and 3-year OS rate of 62% vs. 20% (P&lt;0.0001), compared to those without surgery. The actuarial 3-year rate of grade 3-4 late toxicity was 34%; patients who underwent surgery had a significantly higher rate of grade 3-4 late toxicity compared to those without surgery (54% vs. 16%, P=0.001).CONCLUSIONS: This large, retrospective, single-institution study shows that hyperfractionated accelerated reirradiation was well tolerated. The rate of FFLP was promising, given that the study comprised heavily pre-treated patients with recurrences. Rates of FFLP and OS were particularly impressive in patients who underwent both reirradiation and surgery.	NA	0
28059592	Mutual regulation of microRNAs and DNA methylation in human cancers.	microRNAs (miRNAs) and DNA methylation are the two epigenetic modifications that have emerged in recent years as the most critical players in the regulation of gene expression. Compelling evidence has indicated the roles of miRNAs and DNA methylation in modulating cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. miRNAs act as negative regulators of gene expression and are involved in the regulation of both physiological conditions and during diseases, such as cancer, inflammatory diseases, and psychiatric disorders, among others. Meanwhile, aberrant DNA methylation manifests in both global genome changes and in localized gene promoter changes, which influences the transcription of cancer genes. In this review, we described the mutual regulation of miRNAs and DNA methylation in human cancers. miRNAs regulate DNA methylation by targeting DNA methyltransferases or methylation-related proteins. On the other hand, both hyper- and hypo-methylation of miRNAs occur frequently in human cancers and represent a new level of complexity in gene regulation. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying the mutual regulation of miRNAs and DNA methylation may provide helpful insights in the development of efficient therapeutic approaches.	NA	0
28059591	Epigenetic modification in chromatin machinery and its deregulation in pediatric brain tumors: Insight into epigenetic therapies.	Malignancies are characterized by the reprogramming of epigenetic patterns. This reprogramming includes gains or losses in DNA methylation and disruption of normal patterns of covalent histone modifications, which are associated with changes in chromatin remodeling processes. This review will focus on the mechanisms underlying this reprogramming and, specifically, on the role of histone modification in chromatin machinery and the modifications in epigenetic processes occurring in brain cancer, with a specific focus on epigenetic therapies for pediatric brain tumors.

28059585	Initiation of aberrant DNA methylation patterns and heterogeneity in precancerous lesions of human hepatocellular cancer.	While intratumor heterogeneity contributes to disease progression, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy, it also provides a route to understanding the evolution and drivers of disease. Defects in epigenetic landscapes are intimately linked to pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases, with epigenetic deregulation promoting tumorigenesis. Understanding epigenetic heterogeneity is crucial in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where epigenetic alterations are frequent, early, and pathogenic events. We determined genome-wide DNA methylation and copy number variation leveraging the Infinium 450 K in a series of regenerative nodules from within single patient livers. Bioinformatics strategies were employed to ascertain within-patient heterogeneity, link epigenetic changes to clinical features, and determine their relevance to disease pathogenesis. Our data demonstrate that DNA methylation and copy number alterations evolve during the pre-neoplastic phase of HCC and independently segregate regenerative nodules into distinct clusters. Regenerative nodules with a high frequency of epigenetic changes have significantly lower copy number variation, suggesting that individual nodules have differential enrichment of epigenetic and genetic components, with both contributing to disease progression. Regenerative nodules were scored based on 'epigenetic progression' with higher scores associated with increased proliferation measured by Ki67 staining. Early events observed in epigenetically 'aggressive' nodules are enriched for genes involved in liver cancer. Our study demonstrates that marked epigenetic and genetic heterogeneity exists in early pre-neoplastic liver tissue within individual patients, emphasizing the potential contributions of each mechanism to driving liver disease progression, and it unveils strategies for identifying epigenetic drivers of hepatocellular carcinoma.

28064239	Recurrent somatic mutations affecting B-cell receptor signaling pathway genes in follicular lymphoma.	Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common form of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma, yet it remains only partially characterized at the genomic level. In order to improve our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of this incurable and clinically heterogeneous disease, whole exome sequencing was performed on tumor/normal pairs from a discovery cohort of 24 patients with FL. Using these data, and mutations identified in other B-cell malignancies, 1716 genes were sequenced in 113 FL tumor samples, from 105 primarily treatment-naïve individuals. We identified 39 genes mutated significantly above background mutation rates. CREBBP mutations were associated with inferior PFS. In contrast, mutations in previously unreported HVCN1, a voltage-gated proton channel-encoding gene and B-cell receptor signaling modulator, were associated with improved PFS. In total, 47 [44.8%] patients harbor mutations in the interconnected BCR and CXCR4 signaling pathways. Histone gene mutations were more frequent than previously reported (identified in 43.8% of patients) and often co-occurred (17.1% of patients). A novel, recurrent hotspot was identified at a post-translationally modified residue in the histone H2B family. This study expands the number of mutated genes described in several known signaling pathways and complexes involved in lymphoma pathogenesis (BCR, Notch, SWI/SNF, V-ATPases) and identified novel recurrent mutations (EGR1/2, POU2AF1, BTK, ZNF608, HVCN1) that require further investigation in the context of FL biology, prognosis, and treatment.

28064238	Myeloid malignancies and the microenvironment.	Research in the last few years has revealed a sophisticated interaction network between multiple bone marrow (BM) cells that regulate different hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) properties, such as proliferation, differentiation, localization and self-renewal during homeostasis. These mechanisms are essential to keep the physiological HSC numbers in check and interfere with malignant progression. Besides the identification of multiple mutations and chromosomal aberrations driving the progression of myeloid malignancies, alterations in the niche compartment recently gained attention in contributing to disease progression. Leukaemic cells can remodel the niche into a permissive environment favoring leukaemic stem cell (LSC) expansion over normal HSC maintenance, and evidence is accumulating that certain niche alterations can even induce leukaemic transformation. Relapse after chemotherapy is still a major challenge during treatment of myeloid malignancies and cure is only rarely achieved. Recent progress in the understanding of niche-imposed chemoresistance mechanisms will likely contribute to the improvement of current therapeutic strategies. This Perspective article discusses the role of different niche cells and their stage- and disease-specific roles during progression of myeloid malignancies and in response to chemotherapy.	NA	0
28064214	HSP90 promotes Burkitt lymphoma cell survival by maintaining tonic B cell receptor signaling.	Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is an aggressive B cell neoplasm that is currently treated by intensive chemotherapy in combination with anti-CD20 antibodies. Due to their toxicity, current treatment regimens are often not suitable for elderly patients or for patients in developing countries where BL is endemic. Targeted therapies for BL are therefore needed. In this study, we performed a compound screen in 17 BL cell lines to identify small molecule inhibitors affecting cell survival. We found that inhibitors of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) induced apoptosis in BL cells in vitro at concentrations that did not affect normal B cells. By global proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling we show that in BL, HSP90 inhibition compromises the activity of the pivotal B cell antigen receptor (BCR)-proximal effector spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), which we identified as an HSP90 client protein. Consistently, expression of constitutively active TEL-SYK counteracted the apoptotic effect of HSP90 inhibition. Together, our results demonstrate that HSP90 inhibition impairs BL cell survival by interfering with tonic BCR signaling, thus providing a molecular rationale for the use of HSP90 inhibitors in the treatment of BL.

28064200	Rare variants in GP1BB are responsible for autosomal dominant macrothrombocytopenia.	The von Willebrand receptor complex, which is composed of the glycoproteins Ibα and Ibβ, V and IX, plays an essential role in the earliest steps in hemostasis. Over the last four decades, it has become apparent that loss of function of any one of three of the genes encoding these glycoproteins namely, GP1BA, GP1BB and GP9, leads to autosomal recessive macrothrombocytopenia complicated by bleeding. A small number of variants in GP1BA have been reported to cause a milder and dominant form of macrothrombocytopenia but only two tentative reports exists of such a variant in GP1BB By analyzing data from a collection of over 1,000 genome-sequenced patients with a rare bleeding and/or platelet disorder, we have identified a significant association between rare monoallelic variants in GP1BB and macrothrombocytopenia. In order to strengthen our findings, we sought further cases in two additional collections in the UK and Japan. Across 18 families exhibiting phenotypes consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance of macrothrombocytopenia, we report on 27 affected cases carrying one of 9 rare variants in GP1BB.	NA	2

The cellular phenotype of B-cell lymphomas arising from B cells undergoing germinal center reactions, such as follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, is strongly shaped by mutations in chromatin-modifying genes. The work presented by Jiang and colleagues addresses how somatic mutations in CREBBP disable acetylation and cause unopposed deacetylation by BCL6/SMRT/HDAC3 complexes on enhancers of B-cell signaling and immune response genes.

28062403	Mutated Chromatin Regulatory Factors as Tumor Drivers in Cancer.	Genes encoding proteins that regulate chromatin structure and DNA modifications [i.e., chromatin regulatory factors (CRF)] and genes encoding histone proteins harbor recurrent mutations in most human cancers. These mutations lead to modifications in tumor chromatin and DNA structure and an altered epigenetic state that contribute to tumorigenesis. Mutated CRFs have now been identified in most types of cancer and are increasingly regarded as novel therapeutic targets. In this review, we discuss DNA alterations in CRFs and how these influence tumor chromatin structure and function, which in turn leads to tumorigenesis. We also discuss the clinical implications and review concepts of targeted treatments for these mutations. Continued research on CRF mutations will be critical for our future understanding of cancer biology and the development and implementation of novel cancer therapies.

28062402	The RAS-Effector Interaction as a Drug Target.	About a third of all human cancers harbor mutations in one of the K-, N-, or HRAS genes that encode an abnormal RAS protein locked in a constitutively activated state to drive malignant transformation and tumor growth. Despite more than three decades of intensive research aimed at the discovery of RAS-directed therapeutics, there are no FDA-approved drugs that are broadly effective against RAS-driven cancers. Although RAS proteins are often said to be &quot;undruggable,&quot; there is mounting evidence suggesting it may be feasible to develop direct inhibitors of RAS proteins. Here, we review this evidence with a focus on compounds capable of inhibiting the interaction of RAS proteins with their effectors that transduce the signals of RAS and that drive and sustain malignant transformation and tumor growth. These reports of direct-acting RAS inhibitors provide valuable insight for further discovery and development of clinical candidates for RAS-driven cancers involving mutations in RAS genes or otherwise activated RAS proteins.

28062709	Trifluoperazine, a Well-Known Antipsychotic, Inhibits Glioblastoma Invasion by Binding to Calmodulin and Disinhibiting Calcium Release Channel IP3R.	Calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling is an important signaling process, implicated in cancer cell proliferation and motility of the deadly glioblastomas that aggressively invade neighboring brain tissue. We have previously demonstrated that caffeine blocks glioblastoma invasion and extends survival by inhibiting Ca(2+) release channel inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) subtype 3. Trifluoperazine (TFP) is an FDA-approved antipsychotic drug for schizophrenia. Interestingly, TFP has been recently reported to show a strong anticancer effect on lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and T-cell lymphoma. However, the possible anticancer effect of TFP on glioblastoma has not been tested. Here, we report that TFP potently suppresses proliferation, motility, and invasion of glioblastoma cells in vitro, and tumor growth in in vivo xenograft mouse model. Unlike caffeine, TFP triggers massive and irreversible release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores by IP3R subtype 1 and 2 by directly interacting at the TFP-binding site of a Ca(2+)-binding protein, calmodulin subtype 2 (CaM2). TFP binding to CaM2 causes a dissociation of CaM2 from IP3R and subsequent opening of IP3R. Compared with the control neural stem cells, various glioblastoma cell lines showed enhanced expression of CaM2 and thus enhanced sensitivity to TFP. On the basis of these findings, we propose TFP as a potential therapeutic drug for glioblastoma by aberrantly and irreversibly increasing Ca(2+) in glioblastoma cells.

28062708	Establishment of the In Vivo Efficacy of Pretargeted Radioimmunotherapy Utilizing Inverse Electron Demand Diels-Alder Click Chemistry.	The pretargeting system based on the inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction (IEDDA) between trans-cyclooctene (TCO) and tetrazine (Tz) combines the favorable pharmacokinetic properties of radiolabeled small molecules with the affinity and specificity of antibodies. This strategy has proven to be an efficient method for the molecularly targeted delivery of pharmaceuticals, including isotopes for radiological imaging. Despite encouraging results from in vivo PET imaging studies, this promising system has yet to be thoroughly evaluated for pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT). Toward that end, we synthesized two novel (177)Lu-labeled tetrazine-bearing radioligands. Next, we compared the usefulness of our ligands for PRIT when paired with TCO-modified 5B1-a human, anti-CA19.9 mAb-in preclinical murine models of pancreatic cancer. The exemplary ligand, (177)Lu-DOTA-PEG7-Tz, showed rapid (4.6 ± 0.8% ID/g at 4 hours) and persistent (16.8 ± 3.9% ID/g at 120 hours) uptake in tumors while concurrently clearing from blood and nontarget tissues. Single-dose therapy studies using 5B1-TCO and varying amounts of (177)Lu-DOTA-PEG7-Tz (400, 800, and 1,200 μCi) showed that our system elicits a dose-dependent therapeutic response in mice bearing human xenografts. Furthermore, dosimetry calculations suggest that our approach is amenable to clinical applications with its excellent dosimetric profile in organs of clearance (i.e., liver and kidneys) as well as in dose-limiting tissues, such as red marrow. This study established that a pretargeted methodology utilizing the IEDDA reaction can rapidly and specifically deliver a radiotherapeutic payload to tumor tissue, thus illustrating its excellent potential for clinical translation.

28062707	Optimization of a PEGylated Glucuronide-Monomethylauristatin E Linker for Antibody-Drug Conjugates.	The emergence of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), such as brentuximab vedotin and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, has led to increased efforts to identify new payloads and develop improved drug-linker technologies. Most antibody payloads impart significant hydrophobicity to the ADC, resulting in accelerated plasma clearance and suboptimal in vivo activity, particularly for conjugates with high drug-to-antibody ratios (DAR). We recently reported on the incorporation of a discrete PEG24 polymer as a side chain in a β-glucuronidase-cleavable monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) linker to provide homogeneous DAR 8 conjugates with decreased plasma clearance and increased antitumor activity in xenograft models relative to a non-PEGylated control. In this work, we optimized the drug-linker by minimizing the size of the PEG side chain and incorporating a self-stabilizing maleimide to prevent payload de-conjugation in vivo Multiple PEG-glucuronide-MMAE linkers were prepared with PEG size up to 24 ethylene oxide units, and homogeneous DAR 8 ADCs were evaluated. A clear relationship was observed between PEG length and conjugate pharmacology when tested in vivo Longer PEG chains resulted in slower clearance, with a threshold length of PEG8 beyond which clearance was not impacted. Conjugates bearing PEG of sufficient length to minimize plasma clearance provided a wider therapeutic window relative to faster clearing conjugates bearing shorter PEGs. A lead PEGylated glucuronide-MMAE linker was identified incorporating a self-stabilizing maleimide and a PEG12 side chain emerged from these efforts, enabling highly potent, homogeneous DAR 8 conjugates and is under consideration for future ADC programs.

28062706	Combinatorial Drug Screening Identifies Ewing Sarcoma-specific Sensitivities.	Improvements in survival for Ewing sarcoma pediatric and adolescent patients have been modest over the past 20 years. Combinations of anticancer agents endure as an option to overcome resistance to single treatments caused by compensatory pathways. Moreover, combinations are thought to lessen any associated adverse side effects through reduced dosing, which is particularly important in childhood tumors. Using a parallel phenotypic combinatorial screening approach of cells derived from three pediatric tumor types, we identified Ewing sarcoma-specific interactions of a diverse set of targeted agents including approved drugs. We were able to retrieve highly synergistic drug combinations specific for Ewing sarcoma and identified signaling processes important for Ewing sarcoma cell proliferation determined by EWS-FLI1 We generated a molecular target profile of PKC412, a multikinase inhibitor with strong synergistic propensity in Ewing sarcoma, revealing its targets in critical Ewing sarcoma signaling routes. Using a multilevel experimental approach including quantitative phosphoproteomics, we analyzed the molecular rationale behind the disease-specific synergistic effect of simultaneous application of PKC412 and IGF1R inhibitors. The mechanism of the drug synergy between these inhibitors is different from the sum of the mechanisms of the single agents. The combination effectively inhibited pathway crosstalk and averted feedback loop repression, in EWS-FLI1-dependent manner. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(1); 88-101. ©2016 AACR.	NA	0
28062705	Novel p21-Activated Kinase 4 (PAK4) Allosteric Modulators Overcome Drug Resistance and Stemness in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.	The p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) is a key downstream effector of the Rho family GTPases and is found to be overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells but not in normal human pancreatic ductal epithelia (HPDE). Gene copy number amplification studies in PDAC patient cohorts confirmed PAK4 amplification making it an attractive therapeutic target in PDAC. We investigated the antitumor activity of novel PAK4 allosteric modulators (PAM) on a panel of PDAC cell lines and chemotherapy-resistant flow-sorted PDAC cancer stem cells (CSC). The toxicity and efficacy of PAMs were evaluated in multiple subcutaneous mouse models of PDAC. PAMs (KPT-7523, KPT-7189, KPT-8752, KPT-9307, and KPT-9274) show antiproliferative activity in vitro against different PDAC cell lines while sparing normal HPDE. Cell growth inhibition was concurrent with apoptosis induction and suppression of colony formation in PDAC. PAMs inhibited proliferation and antiapoptotic signals downstream of PAK4. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed disruption of PAK4 complexes containing vimentin. PAMs disrupted CSC spheroid formation through suppression of PAK4. Moreover, PAMs synergize with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in vitro KPT-9274, currently in a phase I clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02702492), possesses desirable pharmacokinetic properties and is well tolerated in mice with the absence of any signs of toxicity when 200 mg/kg daily is administered either intravenously or orally. KPT-9274 as a single agent showed remarkable antitumor activity in subcutaneous xenograft models of PDAC cell lines and CSCs. These proof-of-concept studies demonstrated the antiproliferative effects of novel PAMs in PDAC and warrant further clinical investigations. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(1); 76-87. ©2016 AACR.	therapeutic	1
28062704	Radiosensitization by the ATR Inhibitor AZD6738 through Generation of Acentric Micronuclei.	AZD6738 is an orally active ATR inhibitor (ATRi) currently in phase I clinical trials. We found in vitro growth inhibitory activity of this ATRi in a panel of human cancer cell lines. We demonstrated radiosensitization by AZD6738 to single radiation fractions in multiple cancer cell lines independent of both p53 and BRCA2 status by the clonogenic assay. Radiosensitization by AZD6738 to clinically relevant doses of fractionated radiation was demonstrated in vitro using a 3D tumor spheroid model and, in vivo, AZD6738 radiosensitized by abrogating the radiation-induced G2 cell-cycle checkpoint and inhibiting homologous recombination. Mitosis with damaged DNA resulted in mitotic catastrophe as measured by micronucleus formation by live-cell fluorescent-ubiquitination cell-cycle imaging of cell-cycle progression and nuclear morphology. Induction of micronuclei was significantly more prominent for AZD6738 compared with inhibition of the downstream kinase CHK1 alone at isoeffective doses. Micronuclei were characterized as acentric chromosomal fragments, which displayed characteristics of increased DNA damage and cell-cycle dyssynchrony when compared with the primary nucleus.

28062703	TAS-116, a Novel Hsp90 Inhibitor, Selectively Enhances Radiosensitivity of Human Cancer Cells to X-rays and Carbon Ion Radiation.	Hsp90 inhibitors have been investigated as cancer therapeutics in monotherapy and to augment radiotherapy; however, serious adverse effects of early-generation Hsp90 inhibitors limited their development. TAS-116 is a novel Hsp90 inhibitor with lower adverse effects than other Hsp90 inhibitors, and here, we investigated the radiosensitizing effects of TAS-116 in low linear energy transfer (LET) X-ray and high LET carbon ion-irradiated human cancer cells and mouse tumor xenografts. TAS-116 decreased cell survival of both X-ray and carbon ion-irradiated human cancer cell lines (HeLa and H1299 cells), and similar to other Hsp90 inhibitors, it did not affect radiosensitivity of noncancerous human fibroblasts. TAS-116 increased the number of radiation-induced γ-H2AX foci and delayed the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). TAS-116 reduced the expression of proteins that mediate repair of DSBs by homologous recombination (RAD51) and nonhomologous end joining (Ku, DNA-PKcs), and suppressed formation of RAD51 foci and phosphorylation/activation of DNA-PKcs. TAS-116 also decreased expression of the cdc25 cell-cycle progression marker, markedly increasing G2-M arrest. Combined treatment of mouse tumor xenografts with carbon ions and TAS-116 showed promising delay in tumor growth compared with either individual treatment. These results demonstrate that TAS-116 radiosensitizes human cancer cells to both X-rays and carbon ions by inhibiting the two major DSB repair pathways, and these effects were accompanied by marked cell-cycle arrest. The promising results of combination TAS-116 + carbon ion radiotherapy of tumor xenografts justify further exploration of TAS-116 as an adjunct to radiotherapy using low or high LET radiation.

28062691	Activating mutations and translocations in the guanine exchange factor VAV1 in peripheral T-cell lymphomas.	Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas frequently associated with poor prognosis and for which genetic mechanisms of transformation remain incompletely understood. Using RNA sequencing and targeted sequencing, here we identify a recurrent in-frame deletion (VAV1 Δ778-786) generated by a focal deletion-driven alternative splicing mechanism as well as novel VAV1 gene fusions (VAV1-THAP4, VAV1-MYO1F, and VAV1-S100A7) in PTCL. Mechanistically these genetic lesions result in increased activation of VAV1 catalytic-dependent (MAPK, JNK) and non-catalytic-dependent (nuclear factor of activated T cells, NFAT) VAV1 effector pathways. These results support a driver oncogenic role for VAV1 signaling in the pathogenesis of PTCL.	NA	2
28062688	piggyBac mediates efficient in vivo CRISPR library screening for tumorigenesis in mice.	CRISPR/Cas9 is becoming an increasingly important tool to functionally annotate genomes. However, because genome-wide CRISPR libraries are mostly constructed in lentiviral vectors, in vivo applications are severely limited as a result of difficulties in delivery. Here, we examined the piggyBac (PB) transposon as an alternative vehicle to deliver a guide RNA (gRNA) library for in vivo screening. Although tumor induction has previously been achieved in mice by targeting cancer genes with the CRISPR/Cas9 system, in vivo genome-scale screening has not been reported. With our PB-CRISPR libraries, we conducted an in vivo genome-wide screen in mice and identified genes mediating liver tumorigenesis, including known and unknown tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). Our results demonstrate that PB can be a simple and nonviral choice for efficient in vivo delivery of CRISPR libraries.	NA	0
28063166	Cigarette smoking is associated with adverse survival among women with ovarian cancer: results from a pooled analysis of 19 studies.	Cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk of developing mucinous ovarian tumours but whether it is associated with ovarian cancer survival overall or for the different histotypes is unestablished. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the association between cigarette smoking and survival differs according to strata of ovarian cancer stage at diagnosis. In a large pooled analysis, we evaluated the association between various measures of cigarette smoking and survival among women with epithelial ovarian cancer. We obtained data from 19 case-control studies in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC), including 9,114 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Cox regression models were used to estimate adjusted study-specific hazard ratios (HRs), which were combined into pooled hazard ratios (pHR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) under random effects models. Overall, 5,149 (57%) women died during a median follow-up period of 7.0 years. Among women diagnosed with ovarian cancer, both current (pHR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.08-1.28) and former smokers (pHR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02-1.18) had worse survival compared with never smoking women. In histotype-stratified analyses, associations were observed for mucinous (current smoking: pHR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.01-3.65) and serous histotypes (current smoking: pHR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.00-1.23; former smoking: pHR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.20). Further, our results suggested that current smoking has a greater impact on survival among women with localised than disseminated disease. The identification of cigarette smoking as a modifiable factor associated with survival has potential clinical importance as a focus area to improve ovarian cancer prognosis.

28063165	Diabetes, plasma glucose and incidence of pancreatic cancer: A prospective study of 0.5 million Chinese adults and a meta-analysis of 22 cohort studies.	Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (PC) in Western populations. Uncertainty remains, however, about the relevance of plasma glucose for PC among people without diabetes and about the associations of diabetes and high blood glucose with PC in China where the increase in diabetes prevalence has been very recent. The prospective China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) study recruited 512,000 adults aged 30-79 years from 10 diverse areas of China during 2004-08, recording 595 PC cases during 8 years of follow-up. Cox regression yielded adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for PC associated with diabetes (previously diagnosed or screen-detected) and, among those without previously diagnosed diabetes, with levels of random plasma glucose (RPG). These were further meta-analysed with 22 published prospective studies. Overall 5.8% of CKB participants had diabetes at baseline. Diabetes was associated with almost two-fold increased risk of PC (adjusted HR=1.87, 95% CI 1.48-2.37), with excess risk higher in those with longer duration since diagnosis (p for trend=0.01). Among those without previously diagnosed diabetes, each 1 mmol/L higher usual RPG was associated with a HR of 1.12 (1.04-1.21). In meta-analysis of CKB and 22 other studies, previously diagnosed diabetes was associated with a 52% excess risk (1.52, 1.43-1.63). Among those without diabetes, each 1 mmol/L higher blood glucose was associated with a 15% (1.15, 1.09-1.21) excess risk. In Chinese and non-Chinese populations, diabetes and higher blood glucose levels among those without diabetes are associated with an increased risk of PC. This article is protected by copyright.

28063159	Ethnic differences in the incidence of cancer in Norway.	Traditionally there have been differences in cancer incidence across geographic regions. When immigrants have moved from low-income to high-income countries, their incidence have changed as they have adapted to the lifestyle in the new host country. Given worldwide changes in lifestyle factors over time, we decided to examine cancer incidence in immigrant groups in Norway, a country with a recent immigration history, complete cancer registration and universal public health care. We linked immigration history for the complete population to information on cancer diagnosis from the Cancer Registry of Norway for the period 1990-2012. Age-standardized (world) overall and site-specific cancer incidence were estimated for different immigrant groups and compared to incidence among individuals born in Norway. Among 850 008 immigrants, 9158 men and 10 334 women developed cancer, and among 5 508 429 Norwegian-born, 263 316 men and 235 020 women developed cancer. While incidence of breast and colorectal cancer were highest among individuals born in Norway and other high-income countries, other cancer types were higher in immigrants from low-income countries. Lung cancer incidence was highest in Eastern European men, and men and women from Eastern Europe had high incidence of stomach cancer. Incidence of liver cancer was substantially higher in immigrants from low-income countries than in individuals born in Norway and other high-income countries. Our results mirror known cancer challenges across the world. Although cancer incidence overall is lower in immigrants from low-income countries, certain cancers, such as lung, liver and stomach cancer, represent major challenges in specific immigrant groups.

28064139	Neurological adverse events associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: Review of the literature.	Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting CTLA4 and PD1 constitute a promising class of cancer treatment but are associated with several immune-related disorders. We here review the literature reporting neurological adverse events (nAEs) associated with ICIs. A systematic search of literature, up to February 2016, mentioning nAEs in patients treated with ICIs was conducted. Eligible studies included case reports and prospective trials. One case seen in our ward was also added. Within the 59 clinical trials (totalling 9208 patients) analysed, the overall incidence of nAEs was 3.8% with anti-CTLA4 antibodies, 6.1% with anti-PD1 antibodies, and 12.0% with the combination of both. The clinical spectrum of neurological disorders was highly heterogeneous. Most of these nAEs were grade 1-2 and consisted of non-specific symptoms such as headache (55%). The incidence of high grade nAEs was below 1% for all types of treatment. Headaches, encephalopathies and meningitis were the most commonly reported (21%, 19% and 15%, respectively). Among the 27 case reports, the most common nAEs were encephalopathies, meningoradiculoneuritis, Guillain-Barré like syndromes and myasthenic syndromes. The median time of nAEs onset was 6 weeks. In most cases, drug interruption and steroids led to neurological recovery, even in conditions where steroids are not usually recommended such as Guillain-Barré syndrome.	NA	0

28061893	Prognostic significance of Ki67 in Chinese women diagnosed with ER(+)/HER2(-) breast cancers by the 2015 St. Gallen consensus classification.	BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the distribution pattern of the Ki67-labeling index (LI) among patients at a Chinese breast cancer center, and analyzed its prognostic significance in the 2015 St Gallen consensus breast cancer classification, estrogen receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative(ER(+)/HER2(-))subtype.METHODS: We classified 939 women with ER(+)/HER2(-) breast cancer into three groups by Ki67-LI levels, and followed their clinicopathologic characteristics and prognoses.RESULTS: In the 939 eligible subjects, 342 had Ki67-LI ≤10% (Ki67(Low)), 281 had Ki67-LI between 10 and 30% (Ki67(Medium)), and 316 had Ki67-LI ≥30% (Ki67(High)). Although the Ki67(High) group had less favorable clinicopathologic factors, the Ki67(Medium) group's factors varied considerably. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed that disease-free survival(DFS) for the Ki67(Medium) group was significantly shorter than the Ki67(Low) group but longer than the Ki67(High) group. Ki67-LI had independent prognostic significance in multivariate analysis. Other diagnostic factors, including tumor size &gt;2 cm, positive lymph nodes, and grade III disease, were significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival only in the Ki67(Medium) group.CONCLUSIONS: For patients with ER(+)/HER2(-) breast cancer, we confirmed three distinct risk patterns by Ki67-LI levels according to the 2015 St Gallen consensus. For patients with clearly low or high Ki67-LI, straightforward clinical decisions could be offered, but for patients with intermediate Ki67-LI, other factors might provide valuable information.	NA	0

28061845	Parity and bladder cancer risk: a dose-response meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have reported evidence of an inverse association between parity and bladder cancer risk. However, a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of this association has never been conducted. We conducted this study to clarify this issue.METHODS: Systematic search of PubMed and Embase was performed to identify all the studies. Studies were selected based on strict screening with inclusion and exclusion criteria. Summary relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by using a fixed-effect model, and the generalized least squares trend estimation was employed to compute study-specific RR and 95% CI per live birth increase. Heterogeneity and publication bias were also evaluated.RESULTS: Twelve studies (6,214 cases and 2,693,350 non-cases) were eligible in this meta-analysis. The pooled RR of bladder cancer for parous versus nulliparous women was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.70-0.82). Results were similar in the studies that adjusted for BMI(RR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.53-0.81), cigarette smoking (RR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.57-0.79), and age (RR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.71-0.84). The dose-response meta-analysis showed a lower bladder cancer risk (RR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92-0.98) for each live birth increase in parous women. No evidence of publication bias or significant heterogeneity was detected in the above-mentioned analyses.CONCLUSIONS: The finding from current meta-analysis suggest that parity may be related to decreased risk of bladder cancer.

28061838	Cryptotanshinone activates AMPK-TSC2 axis leading to inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in cancer cells.	BACKGROUND: Cryptotanshinone (CPT), a fat-soluble phenanthraquinone from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, has been demonstrated to inhibit phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), a couple of direct downstream effectors of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), resulting in cancer cell arrested in G0 phase and subsequent inhibition of proliferation. However, its concrete molecular mechanism about how CPT inhibits mTORC1 signaling pathway is unclear.METHODS: one solution was used to check cell viability and western blotting for determining expression of the indicated proteins. Molecular docking was performed to assess the binding of CPT with mTOR. The co-immunoprecipitation assay was to analyze whether CPT could disrupt the mTORC1 and TSC1/TSC2 complex. Recombinant adenoviral dominant-negative AMPKα was used to downregulate expression of AMPKα and lentiviral AMPK and TSC2 to silence the AMPK and TSC2 in Rh30 cells.RESULTS: Primarily, Rh30 cells expressing rapamycin-resistant mutant mTOR are also sensitive to CPT, while the molecular docking result for CPT binding to mTOR is negative, suggesting that CPT inhibition of mTORC1 is different from rapamycin. Then the related proteins of PTEN-PI3K pathway was proved not to be affected, but the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was activated by a concentration- and time- dependent manner, meaning that it may be associated with AMPK. Further results indicated that compound C, inhibitor of AMPK, could clearly reversed CPT inhibitory effect on Rh30 cells, and dominant-negative AMPK in cancer cells conferred resistance to CPT inhibition of 4E-BP1 and phosphorylation of S6K1, as well as sh-AMPK. Furthermore, compared with AMPK-positive MEF cells, AMPK-negative MEF cells are less sensitive to CPT by the findings that 4E-BP1 and phosphorylation of S6K1 express comparatively more. Additionally, phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) was activated under the treatment of CPT, and down-expression of TSC2 by shRNA slightly recovered expression of 4E-BP1 and phosphorylation of S6K1, while co-immunoprecipitation of TSC2 did not alter expression of TSC1 by CPT.CONCLUSION: CPT inhibiting mTORC1 pathway was mostly due to activation of AMPK-TSC2 axis rather than specific binding to mTORC1. CPT is a potent anticancer agent targeting AMPK.	NA	0
28061773	Differential long-term stability of microRNAs and RNU6B snRNA in 12-20 year old archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens.	BACKGROUND: The quantitative analysis of microRNA (miRNA) gene expression in archived formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues has been instrumental to identifying their potential roles in cancer biology, diagnosis, and prognosis. However, it remains unclear whether miRNAs remain stable in FFPE tissues stored for long periods of time.METHODS: Here we report Taqman real-time RT-PCR quantification of miR-21, miR-141, miR-221, and RNU6B small nuclear RNA (snRNA) levels from 92 radical prostatectomy specimens stored for 12-20 years in FFPE blocks. The relative stability of each transcript over time was assessed using general linear models. The correlation between transcript quantities, sample age, and RNA integrity number (RIN) were determined utilizing Spearman rank correlation.RESULTS: All transcript levels linearly decreased with sample age, demonstrating a clear loss of miRNA stability and RNU6B snRNA stability over time. The most rapid rates of degradation were observed for RNU6B and miR-21, while miR-141 and miR-221 were more stable. RNA quality was not correlated with sample age or with miR-21, miR-221, or RNU6B snRNA levels. Conversely, miR-141 levels increased with RNA quality.CONCLUSIONS: MiRNA and snRNA levels gradually decreased over an eight year period in FFPE tissue blocks. Sample age was the most consistent feature associated with miRNA stability. The reference snRNA, RUN6B, was more rapidly degraded when compared to miR-141 and miR-221 miRNAs. Various miRNAs demonstrated differential rates of degradation. Quantitative miRNA studies from long-term archived FFPE tissues may therefore benefit from epidemiologic study design or statistical analysis methods that take into account differential storage-dependent transcript degradation.

28061772	Use of liquid biopsies to monitor disease progression in a sarcoma patient: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Many patients experience local recurrence or metastases after receiving potentially curative treatment, and early detection of these events is important for disease control. Recent technological advances make it possible to use blood plasma containing circulating cell-free tumour DNA (ctDNA) as a liquid biopsy. In this case report we show how serial liquid biopsies can be used to monitor the disease course and detect disease recurrence in a sarcoma patient.CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old male presented with a rapidly growing, painful palpable mass in the left groin region, and a biopsy revealed a high-grade malignant spindle cell sarcoma. No metastases were detected on radiologic imaging scans. Using targeted resequencing with a custom 900 cancer gene panel, eight somatic mutations among them KRAS and NF1, were identified in the primary tumour. Targeted resequencing of plasma cell-free DNA (ctDNA) collected before and after surgery and at disease progression confirmed the presence of six of eight mutations at all three time points. The ctDNA level, estimated from the somatic allele frequencies of these six mutations, was high in plasma taken at the time of surgery, at levels similar to the primary tumour. Detection of low levels of ctDNA three days after surgery indicated persistent microscopic disease. Repeated radiologic imaging six weeks postoperatively showed widespread metastatic disease in the lungs, skeleton and the pelvic region. At this time point there was a dramatic increase in the ctDNA level, reflecting the disease progression of the patient. The patient had an unusually aggressive cancer, and succumbed to the disease 13 weeks after surgery.CONCLUSIONS: This case report demonstrated that targeted resequencing of ctDNA from longitudinal collected plasma can be used to monitor disease progression in a soft tissue sarcoma patient, including manifestation of metastatic disease. The ctDNA represented the genomic profile of the tumour, supporting clinical use of liquid biopsies to identify tumour-specific mutations as well as recurrent disease.	NA	0
28061769	Intraperitoneal cisplatin and doxorubicin as maintenance chemotherapy for unresectable ovarian cancer: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Primary advanced, unresectable ovarian cancer (OC) is treated with palliative systemic chemotherapy. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy may be an alternative local maintenance therapy.CASE PRESENTATION: A 75 year old woman with laparoscopically and histologically confirmed unresectable OC was treated with 13 cycles of intraperitoneal cisplatin 7.5 mg/m(2) and doxorubicin 1.5 mg/m(2) over 2 years using laparoscopic pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC). Objective tumor response (tumor regression on histology, stable disease on repeated video-laparoscopy and peritoneal carcinomatosis index) was noted. No Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) &gt; grade 3 were observed. EORTC QLQ-C30 quality of life measurements were stable throughout the therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Repeated intraperitoneal chemotherapy with cisplatin and doxorubicin applied as PIPAC may be an effective maintenance treatment in women with primary advanced, unresectable OC.

28061768	A matched-pair study comparing whole-brain irradiation alone to radiosurgery or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy alone in patients irradiated for up to three brain metastases.	BACKGROUND: This matched-pair study was initiated to validate the results of a retrospective study of 186 patients published in 2007 that compared whole-brain irradiation (WBI) alone and radiosurgery (RS) alone for up to three brain metastases.METHODS: One-hundred-fifty-two patients receiving WBI alone for up to three brain metastases were matched with 152 patients treated with RS of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) alone 1:1 for each of eight factors (age, gender, Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group (ECOG)-performance score, nature of tumor, brain metastases number, extra-cerebral spread, period from cancer detection to irradiation of brain metastases, and recursive partitioning analysis (RPA)-class. Groups were analyzed regarding intracerebral control (IC) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: On univariate analysis of IC, type of irradiation did not significantly affect outcomes (p = 0.84). On Cox regression, brain metastases number (p &lt; 0.001), nature of tumor (p &lt; 0.001) and period from cancer detection to irradiation of brain metastases (p = 0.013) were significantly associated with IC. On univariate analysis of OS, type of irradiation showed no significant association with outcomes (p = 0.63). On multivariate analyses, OS was significantly associated with ECOG performance score (p = 0.011), nature of tumor (p = 0.035), brain metastases number (p = 0.048), extra-cerebral spread (p = 0.002) and RPA-class (p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSION: In this matched-pair study, RS/FSRT alone was not superior to WBI alone regarding IC and OS. These results can be considered a revision of the findings from our retrospective previous study without matched-pair design, where RS alone resulted in significantly better IC than WBI alone on multivariate analysis.

28061766	Chemotherapy-induced Sinusoidal Injury (CSI) score: a novel histologic assessment of chemotherapy-related hepatic sinusoidal injury in patients with colorectal liver metastasis.	BACKGROUND: Preoperative neoadjuvant therapy for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) is increasing in use and can lead to chemotherapy-induced damage to sinusoidal integrity, namely sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). SOS has been associated with an increased need for intraoperative blood transfusions, increased length of hospitalization post-surgery, decreased tumor response, and a shorter overall survival after resection due to liver insufficiency. It is critical for clinicians and pathologists to be aware of this type of liver injury, and for pathologists to include the status of the background, non-neoplastic liver parenchyma in their pathology reports. In this study, expression of CD34 by sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs), increased expression of smooth muscle actin (SMA) by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and aberrant expression of glutamine synthetase (GS) by noncentrizonal hepatocytes were semiquantitatively evaluated in liver resection or biopsy specimens from patients with CRLM to determine their diagnostic value for assessing chemotherapy-induced sinusoidal injury (CSI).METHODS: The expression of each marker was compared among 22 patients with CRLM with histologically evident SOS (SOS+) and 8 patients with CRLM who had not undergone chemotherapy. Each case was given a histologic grade using the sinusoidal obstruction syndrome index score (SOS-I) to assess the likelihood of SOS. Cases were also given an immunohistochemical grade using the total CSI score calculated as the sum of CD34, SMA, and GS scores.RESULTS: Abnormal staining patterns for CD34 and SMA were significantly more frequent and extensive in SOS+ cases than in the controls (81.8% vs. 25%, P &lt; 0.01; 72.7% vs. 25%, P = 0.03). Aberrant GS expression in midzonal and periportal hepatocytes was only observed in SOS+ cases (31.8% vs. 0%), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. The CSI score was significantly higher in the SOS+ cases when compared to controls (P &lt; 0.01), and was associated with a higher SOS histologic grade (P = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: The CSI score, calculated using an immunohistochemical panel consisting of CD34, SMA, and GS, may serve as an objective marker of chemotherapy-induced sinusoidal injury and could help diagnose this peculiar form of liver injury.

28061765	miR-663a regulates growth of colon cancer cells, after administration of antimicrobial peptides, by targeting CXCR4-p21 pathway.	BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play important roles in the innate immune system of all life forms and recently have been characterized as multifunctional peptides that have a variety of biological roles such as anticancer agents. However, detailed mechanism of antimicrobial peptides on cancer cells is still largely unknown.METHODS: miRNA array and real-time qPCR were performed to reveal the behavior of miRNA in colon cancer HCT116 cells during the growth suppression induced by the AMPs. Establishment of miR-663a over-expressing HCT116 cells was carried out for the evaluation of growth both in vitro and in vivo. To identify the molecular mechanisms, we used western blotting analysis.RESULTS: miR-663a is upregulated by administration of the human cathelicidin AMP, LL-37, and its analogue peptide, FF/CAP18, in the colon cancer cell line HCT116. Over-expression of miR-663a caused anti-proliferative effects both in vitro and in vivo. We also provide evidence supporting the view that these effects are attributed to suppression of the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, resulting in the abrogation of phosphorylation of Akt and cell cycle arrest in G2/M via p21 activation.CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the understanding of the AMPs' mediated anti-cancer mechanisms in colon cancer cells and highlights the possibility of using AMPs and miRNAs towards developing future strategies for cancer therapy.

28061764	Biological toxicities as surrogate markers of efficacy in patients treated with mTOR inhibitors for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Metabolic toxicities of mTOR inhibitors (mTORi) are well characterized. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationship between these metabolic toxicities and mTORi efficacy.METHODS: From 2007 to 2011, metabolic toxicities were retrospectively collected in patients treated with an mTORi (everolimus, temsirolimus) for a metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) in a single institution. Patients were eligible if they have received an mTORi for at least 28 days. Changes in the following parameters were analyzed: lymphocytes, serum creatinine, glycemia, serum phosphate, liver transaminases, cholesterol, and triglycerides. The efficacy was assessed by progression-free survival (PFS) and tumor response.RESULTS: Data were collected from seventy-five patients (everolimus = 44 patients; temsirolimus = 31 patients). Six patients exhibited a partial response, 42 a stable disease and 15 had a progressive disease (12 missing). After a median follow-up of 12.8 months, the median PFS was 6.7 months (95% confidence interval: 4.0-9.1 months). Patients with CB had a statistically more severe absolute increase of glycemia and absolute decrease in phosphatemia (p = 0.002 and p = 0.02 respectively). The Progression Free Survival was significantly higher with the onset rate of hypophosphatemia (p = 0.03) and hyperglycemia (p = 0.001) and lower with the onset rate of lymphopenia (p = 0.004).CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia, hypophosphatemia and lymphopenia, were significantly associated with tumor response and/or PFS. Those events, as well as their onset rate, should be prospectively monitored as predictors of response to mTORi.	NA	0
28062116	Prior breast cancer and tamoxifen exposure does not influence outcomes in women with uterine papillary serous carcinoma.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes in women diagnosed with uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) who have had (UPSCBR+) or have not had (UPSCBR-) an antecedent history of breast cancer and to correlate their outcomes to prior tamoxifen exposure.METHODS: Data were collected for women diagnosed with UPSC at two academic institutions between January 1997 and July 2012. Patient demographics, tumor histology, stage, and treatments were recorded. Patients were divided into two groups: those with and without a personal history of breast cancer. Within the UPSCBR+ cohort, we identified those with a history of tamoxifen use. Cox regression modeling was used to explore associations between selected covariates of interest and the time-to-event outcomes of PFS and OS.RESULTS: Of 323 patients with UPSC, 46 (14%) were UPSCBR+. Of these, 15 (33%) had a history of tamoxifen use. UPSCBR+ patients were older than UPSCBR- (median years, 72 vs. 68, p=0.004). UPSCBR+ women showed no significant difference in PFS or OS compared to UPSCBR- (p=0.64 and p=0.73 respectively), even after controlling for age (p=0.15 and p=0.48 respectively). Within the UPSCBR+ cohort, there was no difference in PFS or OS with or without tamoxifen exposure (p=0.98 and p=0.94 respectively).CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in PFS or OS between the UPSCBR+ and UPSCBR- cohorts. We did not demonstrate significant OS or PFS differences in women who took tamoxifen prior to their endometrial cancer diagnosis. These findings have implications for counseling, and should be encouraging to women who are facing their second cancer diagnosis.	NA	0
28062115	Genotype-matched treatment for patients with advanced type I epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).	BACKGROUND: Genomic alterations that activate the MAPK signaling pathway frequently occur in Type I Epithelial Ovarian Cancers (EOCs). We evaluated therapeutic response outcomes in patients with type I EOC treated with genotype-matched therapy on clinical trials enrolled in a prospective molecular profiling program.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissues were prospectively screened for genomic alterations using MALDI-ToF mass-spectrometry platform or targeted sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel. Treatment outcomes on genotype-matched trials were retrospectively reviewed using RECIST version 1.1 and Gynecological Cancer Intergroup CA125 related-response criteria RESULTS: 55 patients with type I EOC underwent molecular profiling, 41 (75%) low grade serous (LGS), 9 (16%) clear cell (CC), and 5 (9%) mucinous (MC) histologies. Thirty-five patients (64%) were found to have ≥1 somatic mutations: 23 KRAS, 6 NRAS, 5 PIK3CA, 2 PTEN, 1 BRAF, 1 AKT, 1 TP53, and 1 CTNNB1. Fifteen patients were subsequently enrolled in genotype-matched phase I or II trials, including 14 patients with KRAS/NRAS mutations treated with MEK inhibitor targeted combinations. Among 14 RECIST evaluable patients, there were 7 partial responses (PR), 7 stable disease (SD) and 1 disease progression (PD). CA125 responses were observed in 10/10 evaluable KRAS/NRAS mutant patients treated with MEK inhibitor combinations CONCLUSIONS: Genotyping and targeted sequencing of Type I EOCs frequently identifies actionable mutations. Matched treatment with MEK-based combination therapy in KRAS and/or NRAS mutant type I EOC patients is an active therapeutic strategy.	therapeutic	1
28061893	Prognostic significance of Ki67 in Chinese women diagnosed with ER(+)/HER2(-) breast cancers by the 2015 St. Gallen consensus classification.	BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the distribution pattern of the Ki67-labeling index (LI) among patients at a Chinese breast cancer center, and analyzed its prognostic significance in the 2015 St Gallen consensus breast cancer classification, estrogen receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative(ER(+)/HER2(-))subtype.METHODS: We classified 939 women with ER(+)/HER2(-) breast cancer into three groups by Ki67-LI levels, and followed their clinicopathologic characteristics and prognoses.RESULTS: In the 939 eligible subjects, 342 had Ki67-LI ≤10% (Ki67(Low)), 281 had Ki67-LI between 10 and 30% (Ki67(Medium)), and 316 had Ki67-LI ≥30% (Ki67(High)). Although the Ki67(High) group had less favorable clinicopathologic factors, the Ki67(Medium) group's factors varied considerably. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed that disease-free survival(DFS) for the Ki67(Medium) group was significantly shorter than the Ki67(Low) group but longer than the Ki67(High) group. Ki67-LI had independent prognostic significance in multivariate analysis. Other diagnostic factors, including tumor size &gt;2 cm, positive lymph nodes, and grade III disease, were significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival only in the Ki67(Medium) group.CONCLUSIONS: For patients with ER(+)/HER2(-) breast cancer, we confirmed three distinct risk patterns by Ki67-LI levels according to the 2015 St Gallen consensus. For patients with clearly low or high Ki67-LI, straightforward clinical decisions could be offered, but for patients with intermediate Ki67-LI, other factors might provide valuable information.	NA	0

28061845	Parity and bladder cancer risk: a dose-response meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have reported evidence of an inverse association between parity and bladder cancer risk. However, a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of this association has never been conducted. We conducted this study to clarify this issue.METHODS: Systematic search of PubMed and Embase was performed to identify all the studies. Studies were selected based on strict screening with inclusion and exclusion criteria. Summary relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by using a fixed-effect model, and the generalized least squares trend estimation was employed to compute study-specific RR and 95% CI per live birth increase. Heterogeneity and publication bias were also evaluated.RESULTS: Twelve studies (6,214 cases and 2,693,350 non-cases) were eligible in this meta-analysis. The pooled RR of bladder cancer for parous versus nulliparous women was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.70-0.82). Results were similar in the studies that adjusted for BMI(RR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.53-0.81), cigarette smoking (RR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.57-0.79), and age (RR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.71-0.84). The dose-response meta-analysis showed a lower bladder cancer risk (RR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92-0.98) for each live birth increase in parous women. No evidence of publication bias or significant heterogeneity was detected in the above-mentioned analyses.CONCLUSIONS: The finding from current meta-analysis suggest that parity may be related to decreased risk of bladder cancer.

28062831	Glioblastoma on a microfluidic chip: Generating pseudopalisades and enhancing aggressiveness through blood vessel obstruction events.	BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal tumor types. Hypercellular regions, named pseudopalisades, are characteristic in these tumors and have been hypothesized to be waves of migrating glioblastoma cells. These &quot;waves&quot; of cells are thought to be induced by oxygen and nutrient depletion caused by tumor-induced blood vessel occlusion. Although the universal presence of these structures in GBM tumors suggests that they may play an instrumental role in GBM's spread and invasion, the recreation of these structures in vitro has remained challenging.METHODS: Here we present a new microfluidic model of GBM that mimics the dynamics of pseudopalisade formation. To do this, we embedded U-251 MG cells within a collagen hydrogel in a custom-designed microfluidic device. By controlling the medium flow through lateral microchannels, we can mimic and control blood-vessel obstruction events associated with this disease.RESULTS: Through the use of this new system, we show that nutrient and oxygen starvation triggers a strong migratory process leading to pseudopalisade generation in vitro. These results validate the hypothesis of pseudopalisade formation and show an excellent agreement with a systems-biology model based on a hypoxia-driven phenomenon.CONCLUSIONS: This paper shows the potential of microfluidic devices as advanced artificial systems capable of modeling in vivo nutrient and oxygen gradients during tumor evolution.

28062830	Dissecting inherent intratumor heterogeneity in patient-derived glioblastoma culture models.	BACKGROUND: Molecular profile of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) revealed 4 subtypes, 2 of which, proneural and mesenchymal, have been predominantly observed, with the latter displaying a more aggressive phenotype and increased therapeutic resistance. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that multiple subtypes actually reside within the same tumor, suggesting cellular heterogeneity in GBM. Further, plasticity between these 2 subtypes is observed during tumor recurrence and in response to radiation therapy.METHODS: Patient-derived GBM stemlike cells were cultured as neurospheres. These cells were differentiated in serum by attaching to the culture dishes. The &quot;floating&quot; cells that were not attached/differentiated were harvested from the conditioned medium. The characteristics of these cells were studied with limiting dilution assays and immunofluorescence staining. Cell growth and nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkB) activation were monitored using bioluminescent assays as well as quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. In vivo tumorigenesis was evaluated in orthotopic xenograft models using bioluminescence imaging.RESULTS: Patient-derived GBM stemlike cells undergo differentiation by attaching to the culture dish in serum-containing medium. We observed that a small subset of these cells escape this adhesion/differentiation and grow as floating cells. These cells displayed enhanced cancer stem cell properties with a molecular and phenotypic mesenchymal signature, including resistance to radiation and targeted therapies, a more aggressive tumor formation, and NFkB activation.CONCLUSION: Our results endorse inherent intratumor molecular subtype heterogeneity in glioblastoma and provide a valuable approach to study phenotypic plasticity, which could be applied to find novel therapeutic strategies to eradicate this aggressive tumor and can be extended to other cancer types.

28063737	Discovery of Centrosomal Protein 70 as an Important Player in the Development and Progression of Breast Cancer.	Centrosome abnormalities have been implicated in the development and progression of breast cancer. However, the molecular players involved in the above processes remain largely uncharacterized. Herein, we identify centrosomal protein 70 (Cep70) as an important factor that mediates breast cancer growth and metastasis. Cep70 is up-regulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines, and its expression is closely correlated with several clinicopathologic variables associated with breast cancer progression. Mechanistic studies reveal that the up-regulation of Cep70 in breast cancer occurs at the mRNA level and is independent of gene amplification. Cep70 promotes breast cancer cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro and increases tumor growth in mice. In addition, Cep70 stimulates breast cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro. Bioluminescence imaging analysis further shows that Cep70 enhances breast cancer lung metastasis in mice. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for Cep70 in the development and progression of breast cancer and have important implications in the diagnosis and therapy of this malignancy.	NA	0
28064383	Algorithms for prediction of the Oncotype DX recurrence score using clinicopathologic data: a review and comparison using an independent dataset.	PURPOSE: Given the potential savings in cost and resource utilization, several algorithms have been proposed to predict Oncotype DX recurrence score (ODX RS) using commonly acquired histopathologic variables. Although it is promising, additional independent validation of these surrogate markers is needed prior to guide the patient management.METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed 305 patients with invasive breast cancer at our institution who had ODX RS available. We selected five equations that provide a surrogate measure of ODX as previously published by Klein et al. (Magee equations 1-3), Gage et al., and Tang et al. All equations used estrogen receptor status and progesterone receptor status along with different combinations of grade, proliferation indices (Ki-67, mitotic rate), HER2 status, and tumor size.RESULTS: Of all surrogate scores tested, the Magee equation 2 provided the highest correlation with ODX both with regard to raw score (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.66 95% CI 0.59-0.72) and categorical correlation (Cohen's kappa = 0.43, 95% CI 0.33-0.53). Although Magee equation 2 provided a way to reliably identify high-risk disease by assigning 95% of the patients with high ODX RS to either the intermediate- or high-risk group, it was unable to reliably identify the potential for patients to have intermediate- or high-risk disease by ODX (66% of such patients identified).CONCLUSIONS: Although commonly available surrogates for ODX appear to predict high-risk ODX RS, they are unable to reliably rule out the presence of patients with intermediate-risk disease by ODX. Given the potential benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in women with intermediate-risk disease by ODX, current surrogates are unable to safely substitute for ODX. Characterizing the true recurrence risk in patients with intermediate-risk disease by ODX is critical to the clinical adoption of current surrogate markers and is an area of ongoing clinical trials.

28062982	Psychiatric comorbidities among breast cancer survivors in South Korea: a nationwide population-based study.	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of mental disorders in breast cancer survivors using claims data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service in South Korea. We also analyzed patterns of mental disorders with respect to the time of diagnosis and age.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We confirmed mental disorders in a nationwide cohort of 87,843 people who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and underwent surgery between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2014. We investigated the prevalence of mental disorders according to the time of diagnosis and age group. We also examined the utilization patterns of medical institutions and medical departments.RESULT: From one year before a breast cancer diagnosis, 8430 patients were diagnosed with a mental disorder. Of those patients, 3256 were diagnosed with depression (38.6%) and 2739 with anxiety (32.5%). The overall frequency of mental disorders peaked within one month after the cancer diagnosis. The highest rate of increase after diagnosis was noted in stress reaction/adjustment disorders. Depression was relatively high in the young age group, and anxiety was high in the elderly group. In total, there were 59,111 claims for mental disorders. Over 70% (43,788) of claims for mental disorder treatment were from a psychiatry medical department.CONCLUSION: Mental disorders in breast cancer survivors showed different patterns of prevalence according to time, age, and disease. Early intervention could be effective in controlling symptoms of mental disorder and could increase the quality of life for cancer survivors.	NA	0
28062981	Body size from birth through adolescence in relation to risk of benign breast disease in young women.	PURPOSE: Body size, from birth throughout adulthood, is associated with breast cancer risk, but few studies have investigated early-life body size and benign breast disease (BBD), a well-established breast cancer risk factor. We consider whether prenatal factors and size at birth, 10, 18 year, and intervening growth, are related to BBD risk.METHODS: The Growing Up Today Study includes 9032 females who completed questionnaires annually from 1996 to 2001, then 2003, 2005, 2007, 2010, and 2013. In 1996, their mothers provided pregnancy-related data. From 2005 to 2013, participants (18 year+) reported whether they had ever been diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed BBD (N = 142 cases).RESULTS: Girls had greater adiposity (BMI; kg/m(2)) at 10 year if they were larger at birth, if mother's pre-pregnancy BMI was higher, or if gestational weight gain was greater (all p &lt; .01). Maternal height was (positively) associated (p &lt; .05) with adolescent peak height growth velocity (PHV; in./year). Greater 10 year adiposity was associated with lower PHV and less height growth 10-18 year (both p &lt; .01). Adiposity at 10 year was inversely associated with BBD (OR 0.83/(kg/m(2)), p &lt; .01) as was increasing adiposity 10-18 year (OR 0.85/(kg/m(2)), p = .01). In a separate model, 10 year height (OR 1.13/in., p = .02) and height growth 10-18 year (OR 1.19/in.; p &lt; .01) were positively associated. PHV was similarly positively associated (OR 2.58, p = .01, fastest versus slowest growth quartiles). In a multivariable model of BBD risk, gestational weight gain (daughters at highest risk if &lt;20 lb gained), PHV (slowest growing girls at lowest risk), age 10 year height (positive), and BMI (inverse) were the most critical childhood risk factors (each p &lt; .05).CONCLUSIONS: Body size factors from pregnancy through adolescence were independently associated with BBD risk in young women.

28062980	Assessment of an APOBEC3B truncating mutation, c.783delG, in patients with breast cancer.	PURPOSE: APOBEC3B belongs to the family of DNA-editing enzymes. A copy number variant targeting the genomic APOBEC3A-APOBEC3B locus has a significant impact on breast cancer risk, but the relative contribution of APOBEC3B is uncertain. In this study, we investigate a loss-of-function mutation that selectively targets APOBEC3B, for its association with breast cancer risk.METHODS: We performed exome sequencing on genomic DNA samples of 6 Byelorussian patients with familial breast cancer. We then studied through mutation-specific genotyping four hospital-based breast cancer case-control series from Belarus, Russia, Germany, and Iran, respectively, comprising a total of 3070 breast cancer patients and 2878 healthy females. Results were evaluated using fixed-effects meta-analyses.RESULTS: Exome sequencing uncovered a frameshift mutation, APOBEC3B*c.783delG, that was recurrent in the study populations. Subsequent genotyping identified this mutation in 23 additional breast cancer cases and 9 healthy female controls, with an adjusted Odds Ratio 2.29 (95% CI 1.04; 5.03, P = 0.04) in the combined analysis. There was an enrichment of the c.783delG mutation in patients with breast cancer diagnosed below 50 years of age (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.37; 7.56, P = 0.007).CONCLUSIONS: APOBEC3B*c.783delG showed evidence of modest association with breast cancer and seemed to contribute to earlier onset of the disease. These results may need to be reconciled with proposals to consider APOBEC3B as a possible therapeutic target in breast cancer.	NA	2
28062979	Contemporary indications for diagnostic open biopsy in women assessed for screen-detected breast lesions: A ten-year, single institution series of 814 consecutive cases.	PURPOSE: In contemporary practice, 5% of women with non-malignant needle biopsies of screen-detected lesions still require diagnostic open biopsy (OBx). Our aims are to (i) capture a snapshot of the contemporary indications for OBx in screen-detected lesions; (ii) determine upgrade rates to malignancy (DCIS or invasive cancer); (iii) identify indications with sufficiently low upgrades to justify avoidance of OBx and (iv) propose plausible non-surgical alternatives.METHODS: Between Jan 2005 and Dec 2014, women assessed for a screen-detected lesion and recommended for OBx are included. We retrieved patient, imaging, biopsy and final pathology or follow-up data.RESULTS: 814 lesions, mean diameter 16.7 mm, microcalcifications in 353 (43.4%) cases, lesions other than calcifications in 461 (56.6%), mean patient age 58.4 yrs, are included. Surgery was performed in 98.2% cases. Imaging follow-up (1-6.5 yrs) is available in 13 of 15 remaining cases. 27 indications for OBx were identified, with a prevalence of 0.3-13.9%. Borderline lesions (BL) comprised 64% of OBx indications, amongst which atypical ductal hyperplasia was the most prevalent at 13.9%, followed by papillary lesions, radial scars, flat epithelial atypia and lobular neoplasia. Imaging factors contributed 26.3% of OBx. In 9.8% of cases, NCB was not performed due to client, technical or cytologic factors. Overall, 261(32.1%) lesions were malignant at OBx. Upgrade rates varied from 0 to 100%, depending on the specific indication for OBx.CONCLUSIONS: Surgical biopsy remains a valuable method of last resort for breast cancer diagnosis but strategies to limit benign breast surgery merit attention as a public health issue.

28062977	Angiopoietin pathway gene expression associated with poor breast cancer survival.	PURPOSE: Angiogenesis is one of the hallmarks of cancer and is essential for cancer progression and metastasis. However, clinical trials with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway inhibitors have failed to show overall survival benefit in breast cancer. Targeted therapy against the angiopoietin pathway, a downstream angiogenesis cascade, could be effective in breast cancer. This study investigates the association of angiopoietin pathway gene expression with breast cancer survival using a &quot;big data&quot; approach employing RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).METHODS: A total of 888 patients with adequate gene expression, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) data were selected for analysis. DFS and OS were calculated for patients with high and low expression of angiopoietin and VEGF pathway genes using TCGA data. Gene-specific thresholds to dichotomize patients into high and low expression were determined and survival plots were generated.RESULTS: The TCGA cohort was representative of national breast cancer patients with respect to stage, pathology, and survival. High Ang2 gene expression was associated with not only decreased DFS (p = 0.05), but also decreased OS (p &lt; 0.05). High co-expression of Ang2 and its receptor Tie2 was associated with both decreased DFS and OS (p &lt; 0.05). There was strong correlation between angiopoietin and VEGF pathway genes. While high expression of VEGFA alone was not associated with survival, high co-expression with Ang2 was associated with decreased OS.CONCLUSIONS: This study validates TCGA as a representative database providing genomic data and survival outcomes in breast cancer. Our TCGA data support the angiopoietin pathway as a key mediator in the pathologic angiogenic switch in breast cancer.	NA	0
28063065	Effects of long noncoding RNA-ROR on tamoxifen resistance of breast cancer cells by regulating microRNA-205.	PURPOSE: To explore how long noncoding RNA-ROR (lncRNA-ROR) affects the tamoxifen resistance of breast cancer cells.METHODS: Breast epithelial (MCF10A), breast cancer (MCF7), and natural tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cell lines were selected, and the relative lncRNA-ROR expressions were detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In vitro induction of TR5 cell line was performed. There were six groups: MCF7, MCF7/TR5, MDA-MB-231, MCF7-ROR, MCF7/TR5 ROR-siRNA, and the MDA-MB-231 ROR-siRNA groups. CCK-8 assay was conducted to assess the changes in drug resistance of each group. The expression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker was detected using Western blotting. Transwell was selected to test the invasive ability of the cells. Expressions of microRNA-205 (miR-205) and ZEB1/2 were detected using qRT-PCR .RESULTS: Compared with the MCF7 cells, the proliferation rates of the MCF7/TR5 and MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly increased. Compared with the MCF7 cells, the MCF7-ROR cells had remarkably higher proliferation rates, down-regulated E-cadherin and miR-205 expressions, as well as increased vimentin, invasive ability, and mRNA expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2. Compared with the MCF7/TR5 and MDA-MB-231 cells, up-regulated E-cadherin and miR-205 expression, down-regulated expression of vimentin, ZEB1, and ZEB2 mRNA, and decreased invasive ability were observed in the MCF7/TR5 ROR-siRNA and MDA-MB-231 ROR-siRNA cells.CONCLUSION: In MDA-MB-231 cells, down-regulated lncRNA-ROR could inhibit the EMT of breast cancer cells and enhance the sensibility of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen by increasing miR-205 expression and suppressing the expressions of ZEB1 and ZEB2.

28063613	Why and Where do We Miss Significant Prostate Cancer with Multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging followed by Magnetic Resonance-guided and Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Biopsy in Biopsy-naïve Men?	BACKGROUND: Knowledge of significant prostate (sPCa) locations being missed with magnetic resonance (MR)- and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy (Bx) may help to improve these techniques.OBJECTIVE: To identify the location of sPCa lesions being missed with MR- and TRUS-Bx.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a referral center, 223 consecutive Bx-naive men with elevated prostate specific antigen level and/or abnormal digital rectal examination were included. Histopathologically-proven cancer locations, Gleason score, and tumor length were determined.INTERVENTION: All patients underwent multi-parametric MRI and 12-core systematic TRUS-Bx. MR-Bx was performed in all patients with suspicion of PCa on multi-parametric MRI (n=142).OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Cancer locations were compared between MR- and TRUS-Bx. Proportions were expressed as percentages, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In total, 191 lesions were found in 108 patients with sPCa. From these lesion 74% (141/191) were defined as sPCa on either MR- or TRUS-Bx. MR-Bx detected 74% (105/141) of these lesions and 61% (86/141) with TRUS-Bx. TRUS-Bx detected more lesions compared with MR-Bx (140 vs 109). However, these lesions were often low risk (39%). Significant lesions missed with MR-Bx most often had involvement of dorsolateral (58%) and apical (37%) segments and missed segments with TRUS-Bx were located anteriorly (79%), anterior midprostate (50%), and anterior apex (23%).CONCLUSIONS: Both techniques have difficulties in detecting apical lesions. MR-Bx most often missed cancer with involvement of the dorsolateral part (58%) and TRUS-Bx with involvement of the anterior part (79%).PATIENT SUMMARY: Both biopsy techniques miss cancer in specific locations within the prostate. Identification of these lesions may help to improve these techniques.	NA	0
28063378	Overexpression of PTP4A3 in ETV6-RUNX1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Cell signalling, which is often derailed in cancer, is a network of multiple interconnected pathways with numerous feedback mechanisms. Dynamics of cell signalling is intimately regulated by addition and removal of phosphate groups by kinases and phosphatases. We examined expression of members of the PTP4A family of phosphatases across acute leukemias. While expression of PTP4A1 and PTP4A2 remained relatively unchanged across diseases, PTP4A3 showed marked overexpression in ETV6-RUNX1 and BCR-ABL1 subtypes of precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We show that PTP4A3 is regulated by the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion, but noticed no marked impact on cell viability either after PTP4A3 silencing or treatment with a PTP4A3 inhibitor. Regulation of PTP4A3 expression is altered in specific subgroups of acute leukemias and this is likely brought about by expression of the aberrant fusion genes.	NA	2
28064358	Incipient progressive supranuclear palsy is more common than expected and may comprise clinicopathological subtypes: a forensic autopsy series.	We investigated 998 serial Japanese forensic autopsy cases (0-101 years old, mean age 61.7 ± 21.9), with no case selection, using immunohistochemistry to detect cases with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Twenty-nine cases (mean age 82.3 ± 7.2 years, 11 males, 18 females) fulfilled the National Institute of Neuronal Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)-PSP pathological criteria (2.9% of all cases, 4.6% of cases over 60). All had neuronal and glial inclusions in the basal ganglia and brainstem. However, 13 cases had low tau pathology and were categorized as atypical PSP. In addition to PSP pathology, multiple types of astrocytic inclusions and comorbid proteinopathies, particularly a high prevalence of argyrophilic grain disease, were found. All cases had not been diagnosed with PSP and had preserved daily functioning prior to death. However, 14 (48.3%), 11 (37.9%), and 16 (55.2%) cases showed signs of dementia, depressive state, and gait disturbance, respectively. Sixteen accidental death cases (55.2%), including from falls and getting lost, and 11 suicide cases (37.9%) appear to have a relationship with incipient PSP pathology. Cluster analysis using the distribution and amount of 4-repeat-tau pathology classified the cases into three subgroups: Group 1 (10 cases) had typical PSP pathology and seven cases (70.0%) had dementia as the most frequent symptom; Group 2 (7 cases) had significantly higher frequency of gait disorder (6 cases, 85.7%), and less neocortical tau pathology than Group 1; Group 3 (12 cases) had relatively mild PSP pathology and high argyrophilic grain burdens. Granular-shaped astrocytes were the dominant astrocytic inclusion in all cases. We conclude that in forensic cases incipient PSP occurs with a higher prevalence than expected. If these findings can be extrapolated to other population-based cohorts, PSP may be more common than previously thought.	NA	0
28064357	Ischemic stroke: experimental models and reality.	The vast majority of cerebral stroke cases are caused by transient or permanent occlusion of a cerebral blood vessel (&quot;ischemic stroke&quot;) eventually leading to brain infarction. The final infarct size and the neurological outcome depend on a multitude of factors such as the duration and severity of ischemia, the existence of collateral systems and an adequate systemic blood pressure, etiology and localization of the infarct, but also on age, sex, comorbidities with the respective multimedication and genetic background. Thus, ischemic stroke is a highly complex and heterogeneous disorder. It is immediately obvious that experimental models of stroke can cover only individual specific aspects of this multifaceted disease. A basic understanding of the principal molecular pathways induced by ischemia-like conditions comes already from in vitro studies. One of the most frequently used in vivo models in stroke research is the endovascular suture or filament model in rodents with occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), which causes reproducible infarcts in the MCA territory. It does not require craniectomy and allows reperfusion by withdrawal of the occluding filament. Although promptly restored blood flow is far from the pathophysiology of spontaneous human stroke, it more closely mimics the therapeutic situation of mechanical thrombectomy which is expected to be increasingly applied to stroke patients. Direct transient or permanent occlusion of cerebral arteries represents an alternative approach but requires craniectomy. Application of endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor, allows induction of transient focal ischemia in nearly any brain region and is frequently used to model lacunar stroke. Circumscribed and highly reproducible cortical lesions are characteristic of photothrombotic stroke where infarcts are induced by photoactivation of a systemically given dye through the intact skull. The major shortcoming of this model is near complete lack of a penumbra. The two models mimicking human stroke most closely are various embolic stroke models and spontaneous stroke models. Closeness to reality has its price and goes along with higher variability of infarct size and location as well as unpredictable stroke onset in spontaneous models versus unpredictable reperfusion in embolic clot models.

28062906	Programmed cell death-1 pathway inhibition in myeloid malignancies: implications for myeloproliferative neoplasms.	Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematopoietic diseases that belong to the spectrum of myeloid malignancies (MyMs), which also include myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). While hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapeutic approach to many MyMs, the associated morbidity and mortality have necessitated the development of non-HSCT therapeutics for symptom management and disease course modification. Immune checkpoint inhibition, in particular along the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/B7-H1 (PD-L1) axis, is an established strategy in solid tumors with potential as an adjunctive therapy in hematologic malignancies. Seminal studies suggest that the pro-inflammatory microenvironment of MyMs can suppress T lymphocyte-mediated immunity via PD-1 signaling and that response to mainstay epigenetic therapies for MyMs may be governed by PD-1 gene regulation. Although the role of PD-1 signaling in MPN pathogenesis and progression is as yet unclear, research in MPN patients has revealed expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which may effect host immune tolerance of tumor via temporally and spatially specific activation of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling. The current understanding of immune dysfunction in MPNs and analogous MyMs offers a compelling rationale to study PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition in patients as a novel treatment option.	NA	2
28062931	Fewer Reoperations After Lumpectomy for Breast Cancer with Neoadjuvant Rather than Adjuvant Chemotherapy: A Report from the National Cancer Database.	BACKGROUND: Reoperations occur frequently after initial lumpectomy for breast cancer. The authors hypothesized that the receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is associated with fewer reoperations.METHODS: The association between timing of chemotherapy and reoperation rates (ROR) after lumpectomy was investigated for patients with stages 1-3 breast cancer in the National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2010 to 2013 by multivariable logistic regression modeling. Then propensity score-matching was performed.RESULTS: The unadjusted ROR for 71,627 stages 1-3 patients was 11.4% for those who had NAC compared with 20.3% for those who had postoperative chemotherapy (p &lt; 0.001) (odds ratio [OR] 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-0.57; p &lt; 0.001). The ORs for the reoperations performed for patients with stages 1, 2, and 3 cancers who received NAC were respectively 0.65 (95% CI 0.56-0.75), 0.50 (95% CI 0.45-0.56), and 0.27 (95% CI 0.19-0.38) The p values for all were lower than 0.001.CONCLUSION: For a population of patients receiving chemotherapy, the receipt of chemotherapy before instead of after surgery was associated with fewer reoperations after initial lumpectomy for breast cancer.

28063799	Phase II Trial of Dose-dense Pemetrexed, Gemcitabine, and Bevacizumab in Patients With Advanced, Non-Small-cell Lung Cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Platinum-based chemotherapy is standard for untreated, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated the activity and tolerability of the novel combination of dose-dense pemetrexed, gemcitabine, and bevacizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC.METHODS: This multicenter phase II trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of the combination of pemetrexed (400 mg/m(2)), gemcitabine (1200 mg/m(2)), and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg), given every 14 days in patients with untreated, advanced NSCLC. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival with secondary endpoints of response rate and overall survival.RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were enrolled. Treatment was well tolerated; the most common grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia and fatigue. Of the 38 patients evaluable for tumor response, 1 (3%) had complete response, 15 (39%) had partial response, 12 (31%) had stable disease, and 10 (26%) had progressive disease. Median progression-free survival was 6.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.2-7.9) and median overall survival was 18.4 months (95% CI, 13.1-29.5). The 1-year overall survival rate was 64% (95% CI, 51%-81%) and the 2-year overall survival rate was 41% (95% CI, 28%-60%).CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with dose-dense pemetrexed, gemcitabine, and bevacizumab met the primary endpoint with promising efficacy and a manageable safety profile in patients with untreated advanced NSCLC. This regimen represents a reasonable therapeutic option.	NA	0
28062546	The clinical importance of quantifying fat distribution during androgen deprivation.	Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is now considered a mainstay in the treatment of metastatic and locally advanced prostate cancer (PCa). Despite well-established benefits of ADT in relation to overall survival, this treatment has been associated with a number of adverse effects, particularly with regard to key cardiometabolic risk factors including the development of insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and increases in total and regional fat mass. In non-ADT populations, increased levels of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) are thought to be a key mediator of the increased cardiometabolic risk associated with weight gain, but this has received limited attention in men treated with ADT. VAT is best assessed using tools such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, however these tools are not readily accessible for the majority of researchers or clinicians. Recent advances allow for a method of estimating VAT using a whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan that shows promise as a practical tool for researchers to evaluate changes in body fat distribution during ADT. The aim of this narrative review is to (1) review the available evidence with regard to the relationship between ADT and cardiometabolic risk; (2) discuss the role of body fat distribution on cardiometabolic risk in non-ADT populations, with a particular emphasis on the importance of visceral adiposity; (3) examine the potential influence of ADT on body fat distribution and visceral adiposity, and (4) provide an overview of current tools used to measure changes in body fat distribution in men treated with ADT, highlighting the potential utility of a recently developed DXA-derived measure of VAT.

28062545	A review of estrogen receptor/androgen receptor genomics in male breast cancer.	Male breast cancer is a rare disease, of which little is known. In contrast to female breast cancer, the very vast majority of all cases are positive for Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα), implicating the function of this steroid hormone receptor in tumor development and progression. Consequently, adjuvant treatment of male breast cancer revolves around inhibition of ERα. In addition, the Androgen Receptor (AR) gradually receives more attention as a relevant novel target in breast cancer treatment. Importantly, the rationale of treatment-decision making is strongly based on parallels with female breast cancer. Yet, prognostic indicators are not necessarily the same in breast cancer between both genders, complicating translatability of knowledge developed in female breast cancer towards male patients. Even though ERα and AR are expressed both in female and male disease, are the genomic functions of both steroid hormone receptors conserved between genders? Recent studies have reported on mutational and epigenetic similarities and differences between male and female breast cancer, further suggesting that some features are strongly conserved between the two diseases while others are not. This review critically discusses the recent developments in the study of male breast cancer in relation to ERα and AR action, and highlights the potential future studies to further elucidate the genomic regulation of this rare disease.

28062544	Somatic mutation profiling of hobnail variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma.	Hobnail variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (HPTC) represents a recently described, aggressive and rare group of thyroid tumors with poorly understood pathogenesis. Molecular data about this group of cancers are few and a more detailed molecular characterization of these tumors is needed. The main objective of the study is to define a comprehensive molecular typing of HPTC. Eighteen patients affected by HPTC, including eighteen primary tumors and four lymph node metastases, were screened for NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF, TP53, PIK3CA, hTERT, PTEN, CDKN2A, EGFR, AKT1, CTNNB1, and NOTCH1 gene mutations. Sequencing is conducted on the MiSEQ system and molecular data are compared with clinical-pathologic data and follow up. The patients include 14 women and 4 men. Ages range from 23 to 87 years. All 18 primary tumors of HPTC showed ≥30% hobnail features. BRAF and TP53 mutations are by far the most common genetic alterations in primary HPTC (72.2% and 55.6% respectively), followed by hTERT (44.4%), PIK3CA (27.8%), CTNNB1 (16.7%), EGFR (11.1%), AKT1 (5.5%) and NOTCH1 (5.5%). The mutational pattern in primary tumors and metastasis was usually maintained. Univariate Cox regression analyses with bootstrap procedure indicated a significantly increased mortality risk in patients harboring BRAF mutation and BRAF mutation associated with TP53 and/or PIK3CA mutations. The detection of these multiple mutations appears to allow the identification of a subset of more aggressive tumors within the group and to bear information that should be useful for prognostic stratification of these patients including the planning of adjuvant therapy.

28062574	Loss of N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-4 orchestrate oncogenic microRNA-9 in hepatocellular carcinoma.	Deregulated expression of N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GALNTs), which responsible for initiating step of mucin-type O-glycosylation, could produce abnormal truncated O-glycans and thereby exerting pivotal functions during malignant transformation. GALNT4 is one of the few isoforms preferring to catalyze partial GalNAc-glycosylated substrates and modify the sites not utilized by other known GALNTs. This study aims to evaluate the impact of GALNT4 expression on malignant transformation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization analysis were performed to assess GALNT4 and miR-9 level in clinical specimens, respectively. GALNT4 expression is markedly repressed in primary HCC tissues and reduced expression of GALNT4 is significantly associated with adverse survival of patients with HCC. Functional investigations demonstrate that repressed GALNT4 could promote migration, invasion, anoikis resistance and stemness of HCC cells in vitro as well as tumor growth in vivo. The wild-type GALNT4 could modify O-linked glycosylation on EGFR and thus modulate the activity of EGFR. Luciferase activity assay further identified microRNA-9 (miR-9) as the crucial specific arbitrator for GALNT4 expression in HCC cells. Furthermore, restoring GALNT4 expression attenuates miR-9 mediated oncogenic functions. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicates the miR-9/GALNT4 expression signature yield promising prognostic significance to refine the risk stratification of patients with HCC. In conclusions, this study establishes miR-9/GALNT4 axis as a potential adverse prognostic factor and therapeutic target for HCC patients.	NA	2
28063929	MiR-148a and miR-152 reduce tamoxifen resistance in ER+ breast cancer via downregulating ALCAM.	Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), also called CD166 is a 105-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobin superfamily. In this study, we studied the association between ALCAM expression and tamoxifen resistance in ER + breast cancer and further investigated how ALCAM is regulated in the cancer cells. IHC staining data showed that the tumor tissues from non-responders (N = 20) generally had significantly stronger ALCAM staining than that from tamoxifen responders (N = 16). In vitro cell assay also confirmed ALCAM upregulation in tamoxifen resistant (TamR) MCF-7 cells than in tamoxifen sensitive (TamS) MCF-7 cells. ALCAM overexpression significantly alleviated 4-Hydroxytestosterone (4-OHT) induced cell viability inhibition and cell apoptosis in TamS MCF-7 cells, while ALCAM knockdown remarkably enhanced 4-OHT induced cell viability inhibition and cell apoptosis in TamR MCF-7 cells. Demethylation reagent treatment significantly restored miR-148a and miR-152 expression in TamR MCF-7 cells. MiR-148a and miR-152 can directly target ALCAM 3'UTR and decrease ALCAM expression. MiR-148a overexpression had similar effect as ALCAM siRNA on enhancing 4-OHT induced cell viability inhibition and cell apoptosis in TamR MCF-7 cells. MiR-152 overexpression alone caused growth inhibition and increased cell apoptosis in TamR MCF-7 cells. It also enhanced the effect of 4-OHT. Simultaneous inhibition of miR-148a and miR-152 significantly protected TamS MCF-7 cells from 4-OHT induced cell viability inhibition and cell apoptosis. Based on these findings, we infer that MiR-148a and miR-152 can sensitize TamR MCF-7 cells to tamoxifen at least via downregulating ALCAM.	NA	0
28064447	Up-regulation of miR-497 confers resistance to temozolomide in human glioma cells by targeting mTOR/Bcl-2.	The occurrence of an inherent or acquired resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) is a major burden for patients suffering from glioma. Recently, studies have demonstrated that microRNAs play an important role in the regulation of tumor properties in cancers. However, whether miR-497 contributes to glioma resistance to chemotherapy is not fully understood. In this study, we showed that the expression of miR-497 was markedly up-regulated in TMZ-resistant glioma cells; high miR-497 expression level was associated with TMZ-resistant phenotype of glioma cells. The down-regulation of miR-497 in glioma cells enhanced the apoptosis-induction and growth inhibition effects of TMZ both in vitro and in vivo, whereas promotion of miR-497 increased the chemosensitization of glioma cells to TMZ. The increased level of miR-497 in TMZ-resistant glioma cells was concurrent with the up-regulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R)/insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) pathway-related proteins, that is, IGF1R, IRS1, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and Bcl-2. In addition, the knockdown of mTOR and Bcl-2 reduced the tolerance of glioma cells to TMZ. Our results demonstrated that overexpression of miR-497 is significantly correlated with TMZ resistance in glioma cells by regulating the IGF1R/IRS1 pathway. Therefore, miR-497 may be used as a new target for treatment of chemotherapy-resistant glioma.	therapeutic	1
28064471	Vasohibin-2 is required for epithelial-mesenchymal transition of ovarian cancer cells by modulating TGF-β signaling.	Vasohibin-2 (VASH2) is a homologue of VASH1, an endothelium-derived angiogenesis inhibitor. VASH2 is mainly expressed in cancer cells, and has been implicated in the progression of cancer by inducing angiogenesis and tumor growth. While VASH2 has been recently reported to be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), its precise roles are obscure. The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of VASH2 in the EMT of cancer cells in relation to TGF-β signaling, which is a major stimulator of the EMT. Decreased expression of VASH2 in ovarian cancer cells significantly repressed the expression of TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI), namely ALK5. TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 was markedly decreased in VASH2 knockdown cells while the expression of Smad2 and Smad3 was unchanged. Accordingly, the responses to TGF-β1 shown by promoter assay and PAI-1 expression were significantly attenuated in VASH2 knockdown cells. Furthermore, knockdown of VASH2 in cancer cells abrogated the TGF-β1-induced reduced expression of epithelial markers including E-cadherin, and the elevated expression of mesenchymal markers including fibronectin, ZEB2 and Snail2, suggesting that endogenous VASH2 is required for TGF-β1-induced EMT. In accordance with these results, the effects of TGF-β1 on cell morphology, migration, invasion and MMP2 expression were also abrogated when VASH2 was knocked-down. These results indicate that VASH2 played a significant role in the EMT by modulating the TGF-β signaling. We propose that VASH2 would be a novel molecular target for the prevention of the EMT in cancers. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	NA	0
28064454	HGF-MET in cancer progression and biomarker discovery.	Signaling driven by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and MET receptor facilitates conspicuous biological responses such as epithelial cell migration, 3-D morphogenesis, and survival. The dynamic migration and promotion of cell survival induced by MET activation are bases respectively for invasion-metastasis and resistance against targeted drugs in cancers. Recent studies indicated that MET in tumor-derived exosomes facilitates metastatic niche formation and metastasis in malignant melanoma. In lung cancer, gene amplification-induced MET activation and ligand-dependent MET activation in autocrine/paracrine manner are causes for resistance to EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and ALK inhibitors. HGF secreted in the tumor microenvironment contributes to the innate and acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors. Changes in serum/plasma HGF, soluble MET, and phosphor-MET have been confirmed to be associated with disease progression, metastasis, therapy response, and survival. Higher serum/plasma HGF levels are associated with therapy resistance and/or metastasis, while lower HGF levels are associated with progression-free survival and overall survival after treatment with targeted drugs in lung cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, and malignant melanoma. Urinary soluble MET levels in patients with bladder cancer are higher than those in patients without bladder cancer and associated with disease progression. Some of the multi-kinase inhibitors that target MET have received regulatory approval, whereas none of the selective HGF-MET inhibitors have shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials. Validation of the HGF-MET pathway as a critical driver in cancer development/progression and utilization of appropriate biomarkers are key to development and approval of HGF-MET inhibitors for clinical use.

28064445	A panel of autoantibodies against multiple tumor-associated antigens for detecting gastric cancer.	Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the world, and effective diagnosis is extremely important for good outcome. We assessed the diagnostic potential of an autoantibody panel that may provide a novel tool for the early detection of gastric cancer. We analyzed data from patients with gastric cancer and normal controls in a test and validation cohorts. Autoantibody levels were measured against a panel of six tumor-associated antigens [TAAs; p53, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), HCC-22-5, peroxiredoxin VI (Prx VI), KM-HN-1, and p90 TAA (CYP2A)] via ELISA. We assessed serum autoantibodies in 100 participants in the test cohort. The validation cohort comprised 248 participants. Autoantibodies to at least one of the six antigens demonstrated a sensitivity/specificity of 49.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 39.2-58.8%]/92.4% (95% CI, 87.2-97.6%) and 52.0% (95% CI, 42.2-61.8%)/90.5% (95% CI, 84.8-96.3%) in the test and validation cohorts, respectively. In the validation cohort, no significant differences were seen when patients were subdivided based on age, sex, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, peritoneal dissemination, and TNM stage. Patients who were positive for more than two antibodies in the panel tended to have a worse prognosis than those who were positive for one or no antibody. Measurement of autoantibody response to multiple TAAs in an optimized panel assay to discriminate patients with early stage gastric cancer from normal controls may aid in the early detection of gastric cancer.

28064442	Tumor-derived spheroids: Relevance to cancer stem cells and clinical applications.	Recently, many types of in vitro three-dimensional (3D) culture systems have been developed to recapitulate the in vivo growth conditions of cancer. The cancer 3D culture methods aim to preserve the biological characteristics of original tumors better than conventional two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultures, and include tumor-derived organoids, tumor-derived spheroids, organotypic multicellular spheroids, and multicellular tumor spheroids. The 3D culture methods differ in terms of cancer cell sources, protocols for cell handling, and the required time intervals. Tumor-derived spheroids are unique because they are purposed for the enrichment of cancer stem cells (CSCs) or cells with stem cell-related characteristics. These spheroids are grown as floating spheres and have been used as surrogate systems to evaluate the CSC-related characteristics of solid tumors in vitro. Because eradication of CSCs is likely to be of clinical importance due to their association with the malignant nature of cancer cells such as tumorigenicity or chemoresistance, the investigation of tumor-derived spheroids may provide invaluable clues to fight against cancer. Spheroid cultures have been established from cancers including glioma, breast, colon, ovary, and prostate cancers, and their biological and biochemical characteristics have been investigated by many research groups. In addition to the investigation of CSCs, tumor-derived spheroids may prove to be instrumental for a high-throughput screening platform or for the cultivation of CSC-related tumor cells found in the circulation or body fluids.

28064436	MiR-181b-5p, ETS1 and c-Met pathway exacerbates the prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma after radiation therapy.	Preoperative chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has emerged as a reasonable strategy that shows good prognostic impact. However, after preoperative CRT, resected specimens exhibited remnant tumor cells, which indicated that some tumor cells had acquired or were selected for resistance to CRT. Recently, two oncological mechanisms, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) were reported to be associated with resistance in various cancers. Previous reports showed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) could induce EMT in PDAC cells; moreover, the HGF receptor, c-Met, was identified as a dominant pancreatic CSC marker. However, clinical significance of c-Met expression remains unclear. So, we hypothesized that remnant PDAC tissue after CRT might harbor cells with c-Met high expression, and these cells may exacerbate patients' prognosis. In the immunohistochemical analysis, we demonstrated that preoperative CRT was significantly associated with high c-Met expression; moreover, high c-Met expression was a significant marker of a dismal prognosis. Next, we investigated mechanisms of c-Met upregulation in PDAC cells. We established gemcitabine-resistant and radio-resistant PDAC cells to analyze the transcriptome involved in c-Met expression. The microarray data for the established radiation-resistant PDAC cells indicates miR-181b-5p down regulation, which targets ETS1, one of the transcriptional factor for c-Met, and it was demonstrated that radiation exposure induced c-Met expression through ETS1 increase by the suppression miR-181b-5p. These results suggested that targeting these mechanisms may promote the development of a novel multidisciplinary treatment strategy for improving preoperative CRT efficiency.

28062409	D-mannose: a Novel Prognostic Biomarker for Patients with Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.	Metabolomic profiling isa promising approach to identify new biomarkers for cancer prognosis.However, the role of circulating metabolites as prognostic indicators in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has not been well-explored. In this study, we aimed to evaluatethe prognostic value of three serum metabolites, D-mannose, L-proline (LP), and 3-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), which were significantly different between EAC patients and controls,identified through a global and targeted metabolite profiling.We measured the levels ofD-mannose, LP, and BHBA in pretreatment serum from 159 EAC patients, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods. A multivariableCox modelwas used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the association of these metabolites with recurrence andoverall survival.We found that serumlevels of D-mannoseweresignificantly associated with recurrence and overall survival in EAC patients, whereas levels of LP and BHBA were not. Compared to patients with a low (first tertile) level of D-mannose, those witha high (second plus third tertiles) level had 49% reduced risk of recurrence (HR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.29-0.91; P = 0.02), and 56%reduced risk of death (HR = 0.44; 95% CI:0.25-0.77, P&lt;0.01).The significant association of high D-mannose levels with better prognosis was consistent among patients with early-stage and advanced-stage EAC. Our resultssuggestthat serumlevel of D-mannose may be used as a novelprognostic biomarker for patients with EAC.Further studies in independent populations are warranted to confirm our findings.	NA	0
28062916	Low-dose anti-thymocyte globulin reduce severe acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) administered at 5-10 mg/kg can prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We sought to investigate the potential for lower doses of ATG to decrease non-relapse mortality (NRM).METHODS: We consecutively compared the outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who received allogeneic stem cell transplants from allogeneic related or unrelated donors before February 2010 and were not administered ATG (reference arm), with those administered 2.5 mg/kg ATG after March 2010 (treatment arm).RESULTS: We recruited 19 patients into each arm (median age 49 years, range 19-64). 16 patients received myeloablative preparation regimens and 22 patients received toxicity-reduced preparation regimens. All but one patient achieved engraftment, and one secondary graft failure was observed. Overall incidence of acute and chronic GVHD were 63.2 and 15.8%, respectively, in the ATG arm (21.1% grade II to IV, and 0.0% grade III/IV acute GVHD), and 57.9 and 47.4%, respectively, in the reference arm (31.6% grade II to IV, and 21.1% grade III/IV acute GVHD). The estimated probability of overall survival (OS) at 6 years and relapse rate 3 years after transplantation were 49.2 and 26.3% for the ATG arm, respectively, and 54.2 and 21.1% for the reference arm, respectively. The rate of NRM was 10.5% in the ATG arm and 26.3% in the reference arm. No patients died as a result of acute or chronic GVHD.CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ATG may suppress severe acute GVHD and chronic GVHD without increasing NRM, and can be used safely for Japanese patients receiving transplants from HLA-matched donors.

28063205	Pathogenetic determinants in Kawasaki disease: the haematological point of view.	Kawasaki disease is a multisystemic vasculitis that can result in coronary artery lesions. It predominantly affects young children and is characterized by prolonged fever, diffuse mucosal inflammation, indurative oedema of the hands and feet, a polymorphous skin rash and non-suppurative lymphadenopathy. Coronary artery involvement is the most important complication of Kawasaki disease and may cause significant coronary stenosis resulting in ischemic heart disease. The introduction of intravenous immunoglobulin decreases the incidence of coronary artery lesions to less than 5%. The etiopathogenesis of this disease remains unclear. Several lines of evidence suggest that an interplay between a microbial infection and a genetic predisposition could take place in the development of the disease. In this review, we summarize the state of the art of pathogenetic mechanisms of Kawasaki disease underscoring the relevance of haematological features as a novel field of investigation.	NA	0
28064206	Retrospective analysis of survival in patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis from lung adenocarcinoma treated with erlotinib and gefitinib.	BACKGROUND: Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is a relatively rare metastatic form of non-small cell lung cancer, which can impact prognosis. There is an increasing need for selecting suitable epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors among those currently included in standard care for EGFR mutation-positive patients. We compared the efficacy of gefitinib and erlotinib in survival of patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 269 patients who received tyrosine kinase inhibitors at a single center were retrospectively reviewed. Overall, 22 patients (8.2%) were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis from non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutation between 2006 and 2016. Time to death from leptomeningeal carcinomatosis diagnosis was compared between the gefitinib and erlotinib groups.RESULTS: Gefitinib and erlotinib were administrated to 5 and 17 patients, respectively. Median progression-free survival was longer in the erlotinib group than in the gefitinib group (6.60 vs 2.12 months, P = 0.07). Overall survival was more than twice as long in the erlotinib arm compared with that in the gefitinib arm (7.20 vs 2.99 months, P = 0.32). Response in patients with exon 19 deletion was better than in those with exon 21 mutation (overall survival, 7.20 and 5.62 months, respectively, P = 0.12).CONCLUSIONS: Erlotinib seemed more effective than gefitinib in prolonging survival in leptomeningeal carcinomatosis from EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer and may be particularly beneficial in patients with EGFR exon 19 mutations, warranting further studies.	therapeutic	1
28064204	A histological positive margin after surgery is correlated with high local re-recurrence rate in patients with recurrent myxofibrosarcoma.	OBJECTIVE: Myxofibrosarcoma has high frequency of local recurrence after surgery. To determine an optimal treatment for recurrent tumors, clinical features of recurrent cases should be characterized.METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 30 patients with recurrent myxofibrosarcoma who underwent surgery between 1999 and 2008.RESULTS: A negative margin after surgery was achieved in only 12 patients (40.0%). The 5-year re-recurrence free-survival rate was 31.7%. The 5-year re-recurrence free survival for those with positive histological margin and those with negative margin were 9.8% and 62.3%, respectively, which indicated that a positive margin was the significant predictor of poor prognosis (P = 0.006). In 21 patients with recurrent myxofibrosarcoma in the extremities, 10 patients (47.6%) ultimately underwent amputation in the follow-up period and the 5-year amputation-free survival rate was 62.5%. The 5-year metastasis-free survival rates and the 5-year overall survival rates were 84.8% and 83.6%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the majority of recurrent cases could not achieve negative margins; notably, a positive margin is a significant poor prognostic indicator of local re-recurrence in patients with recurrent myxofibrosarcoma. To control local recurrence of myxofibrosarcoma was extremely difficult and amputation is often needed in the extremity cases.	NA	0
28064203	Predictive factors of gastroduodenal bleeding after postoperative radiotherapy in biliary tract cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To identify predictive factors for gastroduodenal bleeding after postoperative radiation therapy in patients with biliary tract cancer.METHODS: We identified 186 patients with biliary tract cancer who completed scheduled postoperative radiation therapy from March 2000 to August 2013. To isolate the effects of radiation on gastroduodenal bleeding, patients with pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, pylorus-resecting pancreaticoduodenectomy or Whipple surgery (n = 67) were excluded from this analysis. Postoperative radiation therapy was started at a median 5 weeks (range: 4-12 weeks) after surgery with a median dose of 44 Gy (range: 44-54), and chemotherapy was also concurrently administered to 102 patients.RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 59 years (range: 36-76 years). Of the 119 patients, 26 had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 29 had hilar cholangiocarcinoma, while 64 had extrahepatic tumors (gallbladder cancer, n = 53; proximal bile duct cancer, n = 10; choledochal cyst cancer, n = 1). Of all, 11 patients (9%) developed gastroduodenal bleeding. In univariate analyses, hepatic artery resection and gastroduodenal wall thickening on postoperative radiation therapy simulation computed tomography were statistically significant factors for gastroduodenal bleeding. Multivariate analysis by a logistic regression model using those two variables revealed that both parameters were independent predictors for gastroduodenal bleeding.CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant hepatic artery resection and presence of gastroduodenal wall thickening on postoperative radiation therapy simulation computed tomography were predictive factors for gastroduodenal bleeding after postoperative radiation therapy in biliary tract cancer. In such cases, patients should be informed of the high risk of gastroduodenal bleeding, and should be closely observed during and after postoperative radiation therapy.	NA	0
28063307	SHARPIN Facilitates p53 Degradation in Breast Cancer Cells.	The ubiquitin binding protein SHAPRIN is highly expressed in human breast cancer, one of the most frequent female malignancies worldwide. Here, we perform SHARPIN depletion in breast cancer cells together with RNA sequencing. The global expression profiling showed p53 signaling as a potential SHARPIN target. SHARPIN depletion decreased cell proliferation, which effect could be rescue by p53 knocking down. Depletion SHARPIN significantly increases p53 protein level and its target genes in multiple breast cancer cell lines. Further experiment revealed that SHARPIN could facilitate p53 poly-ubiquitination and degradation in MDM2 dependent manner. Immuno-precipitation assay showed that SHARPIN associated with MDM2 and prolonged MDM2 protein stability. Analysis of public available database showed SHARPIN correlated with poor prognosis specifically in p53 wild-type breast cancer patients. Together, our finding revealed a novel modifier for p53/MDM2 complex and suggested SHARPIN as a promising target to restore p53 function in breast cancer.	NA	0
28062918	Glycine decarboxylase and HIF-1α expression are negative prognostic factors in primary resected early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.	Glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) was recently described as a critical enzyme of tumor-initiating cells and, thus, a driver of tumorigenesis in lung non-small cell cancer (NSCC). It is important in metabolism under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) is the unique subunit that determines HIF system activity, thereby regulating the adverse effects of hypoxia on cancer outcome. We examined the expression and prognostic significance of GLDC and HIF-1α in primary resected stage I/II NSCC. Immunohistochemistry for GLDC and HIF-1α was validated on two lung NSCC cell lines (A549, NCI-H460) and evaluated on a tissue microarray with 428 lung NSCC: 184 adenocarcinomas, 211 squamous cell carcinomas, and 33 large cell carcinomas (LCC). The results were correlated with clinico-pathological parameters. High levels of GLDC expression were detected in 33/428 cases (7.7%). HIF-1α was expressed in 71 (16.6%) cases and more frequently in squamous cell carcinoma (p &lt; 0.001). Significantly longer survival was seen in younger patients (p = 0.007), patients with non-LCC histology (p = 0.006), lower primary tumor category (p = 0.002), and Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stage (p = 0.001). Both GLDC and HIF-1α were significantly associated with worse tumor-related survival (p = 0.013, p = 0.021, respectively), although not independent from each other in multivariate models. The combination of low-GLDC/negative HIF-1α expression was significantly prognostic for longer survival (p = 0.002) and emerged as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (p = 0.007, HR 2.052), next to UICC stage and age. We show that the combination of GLDC and HIF-1α expression is an independent prognostic factor in early-stage NSCC. Our results will assist future development of therapeutic approaches targeting GLDC or exploiting tumor hypoxia.	NA	0
28062937	Protocol for enhanced recovery after surgery improves short-term outcomes for patients with gastric cancer: a randomized clinical trial.	BACKGROUND: The feasibility of the use of the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol in patients with gastric cancer remains unclear.METHODS: This study was a single-center, prospective randomized trial involving patients with gastric cancer undergoing curative gastrectomy. The primary end point was the length of postoperative hospital stay. Secondary end points were the postoperative complication rate, admission costs, weight loss, and amount of physical activity.RESULTS: From July 2013 to June 2015, we randomized 148 patients into an ERAS protocol group (n = 73) and a conventional protocol group (n = 69); six patients withdrew from the study. The hospital stay was significantly shorter in the ERAS protocol group than in the conventional protocol group (9 days vs 10 days; P = 0.037). The ERAS protocol group had a significantly lower rate of postoperative complications of grade III or higher (4.1% vs 15.4%; P = 0.042) and reduced costs of hospitalization (JPY 1,462,766 vs JPY 1,493,930; P = 0.045). The ratio of body weight to preoperative weight at 1 week and 1 month after the operation was higher in the ERAS protocol group (0.962 vs 0.957, P = 0.020, and 0.951 vs 0.937, P = 0.021, respectively). The ERAS protocol group recorded more physical activity in the first week after surgery.CONCLUSIONS: The ERAS protocol is safe and efficient, and seems to improve the postoperative course of patients with gastric cancer.

28063196	ASXL2 Mutations are Frequently Found in Pediatric AML Patients with t(8;21)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and Associated with a Better Prognosis.	ASXL2 is an epigenetic regulator involved in polycomb repressive complex regulation or recruitment. Clinical features of pediatric AML patients with ASXL2 mutations remain unclear. Thus, we investigated frequencies of ASXL1 and ASXL2 mutations, clinical features of patients with these mutations, correlations of these mutations with other genetic alterations including BCOR/BCORL1 and cohesin complex component genes, and prognostic impact of these mutations in 369 pediatric patients with de novo AML (0-17 years). We identified 9 (2.4%) ASXL1 and 17 (4.6%) ASXL2 mutations in 25 patients. These mutations were more common in patients with t(8;21)(q22;q22)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (ASXL1, 6/9, 67%, P = 0.02; ASXL2, 10/17, 59%, P = 0.01). Among these 25 patients, 4 (27%) of 15 patients with t(8;21) and 6 (60%) of 10 patients without t(8;21) relapsed. However, most patients with relapse were rescued using stem cell transplantation irrespective of t(8;21). The overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates showed no differences among pediatric AML patients with t(8;21) and ASXL1 or ASXL2 mutations and ASXL wild-type (5-year OS, 75% vs. 100% vs. 91% and 5-year EFS, 67% vs. 80% vs. 67%). In 106 patients with t(8;21) AML, the coexistence of mutations in tyrosine kinase pathways and chromatin modifiers and/or cohesin complex component genes had no effect on prognosis. These results suggest that ASXL1 and ASXL2 mutations play key roles as cooperating mutations that induce leukemogenesis, particularly in pediatric AML patients with t(8;21), and these mutations might be associated with a better prognosis than that reported previously.

28063190	Prognostic Impact of Specific Molecular Profiles in Pediatric Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia in Non-Down Syndrome.	Pediatric acute megakaryoblastic leukemia with non-Down syndrome (AMKL) is a unique subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Novel CBFA2T3-GLIS2 and NUP98-KDM5A fusions recurrently found in AMKL were recently reported as poor prognostic factors. However, their detailed clinical and molecular characteristics in patients treated with recent improved therapies remain uncertain. We analyzed molecular features of 44 AMKL patients treated on two recent Japanese AML protocols, the AML99 and AML-05 trials. We identified CBFA2T3-GLIS2, NUP98-KDM5A, RBM15-MKL1, and KMT2A rearrangements in 12 (27%), 4 (9%), 2 (5%), and 3 (7%) patients, respectively. Among 459 other AML patients, NUP98-KDM5A was identified in 3 patients, whereas CBFA2T3-GLIS2 and RBM15-MKL1 were only present in AMKL. GATA1 mutations were found in 5 patients (11%). Four-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates of CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive patients in AMKL were 41.7% and 16.7%, respectively. Three-year cumulative incidence of relapse in CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive patients was significantly higher than that of CBFA2T3-GLIS2-negative patients (75.0% vs 35.7%, P = 0.024). In multivariate analyses, CBFA2T3-GLIS2 was an independent poor prognostic factor for OS (HR, 4.34; 95% CI, 1.31-14.38) and EFS (HR, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.20-7.23). Furthermore, seven (54%) of 13 infant AMKL patients were CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive. Notably, out of 7 CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive infants, six (86%) relapsed and five (71%) died. Moreover, all of CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive patients who experienced induction failure (n = 3) were infants, indicating worse prognosis of CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive infants. These findings indicated the significance of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 as a poor prognostic factor in AMKL patients, particularly in infants. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	NA	0
28063177	Comparable Clinical Outcomes in Patients with HER2-mutant and EGFR-mutant Lung Adenocarcinomas.	HER2 is a major proliferative driver in lung cancer. HER2 gene aberrations impact the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (ADC). A one-step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed using RNA samples from 888 Asian lung cancer patients to detect HER2, EGFR, KRAS, ALK, and ROS1 mutations. The demographic data and treatment outcomes of HER2 mutation-positive lung ADC patients were analyzed and compared to those with HER2 mutation-negative tumors. HER2 mutation was identified in 40 (4.5%) lung ADC patients. HER2 mutations tended to occur in male patients with advanced-stage disease and never-smokers. A775_G776insYVMA (n = 22, 55%) was the most prevalent HER2 mutation, followed by P780_Y781insGSP (n = 4, 10%). For patients diagnosed with stage-IIIB/IV disease, HER2-mutant patients showed clinical outcomes comparable to EGFR-mutant patients (P = 0.721, log-rank test) and a better overall survival (OS) compared to patients lacking driver mutations in the investigated genes (P = 0.033, Breslow test). Specifically, lung ADC patients with stage-IV HER2-mutant tumors treated with chemotherapy or targeted agents, even without afatinib or anti-HER2 targeted therapy, showed similar clinical outcomes to lung ADC patients harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutations (P = 0.870). In addition, multivariate analysis indicated that HER2 mutation status was not a major risk factor for diminished OS in stage-IV lung cancer. In conclusion, lung ADC harboring HER2 mutations showed distinct characteristics from other driver mutations, including increased chemosensitivity with in advanced stage disease.

28061878	Blockage of glycolysis by targeting PFKFB3 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Many cancers including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are characterized by a metabolic rewiring with increased glucose uptake and lactate production, termed as aerobic glycolysis. Targeting aerobic glycolysis presents a promising strategy for cancer therapy. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of glycolysis blockage by targeting phosphofructokinase-2/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) in HNSCC.METHODS: 1-(4-pyridinyl)-3-(2-quinolinyl)-2-propen-1-one (PFK15) was used as a selective antagonist of PFKFB3. Glycolytic flux was determined by measuring glucose uptake, lactate production and ATP yield. PFKFB3 expression was examined using HNSCC tissue arrays. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and motility were analysed. HNSCC xenograft mouse model and metastasis mouse model were established to examine the therapeutic efficacy of PFK15 in vivo.RESULTS: HNSCC showed an increased PFKFB3 expression compared with adjacent mucosal tissues (P &lt; 0.01). Targeting PFKFB3 via PFK15 significantly reduced the glucose uptake, lactate production and ATP generation in HNSCC cell lines. PFK15 suppressed cell proliferation, halted cell cycle progression and induced cell apoptosis. The invadopodia of HNSCC cells was markedly reduced after PFK15 treatment, thereby impairing cell motility and extracellular matrix degradation ability. The in vivo data from the xenograft mice models proved that PFK15 administration suppressed the tumor growth. And the results from the metastatic mice models showed administration of PFK15 alleviated the lung metastasis of HNSCC and extended the life expectancy of mice.CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacological inhibition of PFKFB3 via PFK15 suppressed tumor growth and alleviated metastasis in HNSCC, offering a promising strategy for cancer therapy.

28061785	Short-term early exposure to lapatinib confers lifelong protection from mammary tumor development in MMTV-erbB-2 transgenic mice.	BACKGROUND: Although chemopreventative agents targeting the estrogen/estrogen receptor (ER) pathway have been effective for ER(+) breast cancers, prevention of hormone receptor-negative breast cancers, such as Her2/erbB-2(+) breast cancers, remains a significant issue. Previous studies have demonstrated that administration of EGFR/erbB-2-targeting lapatinib to MMTV-erbB-2 transgenic mice inhibited mammary tumor development. The prevention, however, was achieved by prolonged high dose exposure. The tolerance to high dose/long-term drug administration may hinder its potential in clinical settings. Therefore, we aimed to test a novel, short-term chemopreventative strategy using lapatinib during the premalignant risk window in MMTV-erbB-2 mice.METHODS: We initially treated cultured cells with lapatinib to explore the anti-proliferative effects of lapatinib in vitro. We used a syngeneic tumor graft model to begin exploring the in vivo anti-tumorigenic effects of lapatinib in MMTV-erbB-2 mice. Then, we tested the efficacy of brief exposure to lapatinib (100 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks), beginning at 16 weeks of age, in the prevention of mammary tumor development in MMTV-erbB-2 mice.RESULTS: In the syngeneic tumor transplant model, we determined that lapatinib significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that short-term lapatinib exposure resulted in life-long protective effects, as supported by increased tumor latency in lapatinib-treated mice compared to the control mice. We further established that delayed tumor development in the treated mice was preceded by decreased BrdU nuclear incorporation and inhibited mammary morphogenesis. Molecular analysis indicated that lapatinib inhibited phosphorylation and expression of EGFR, erbB-3, erbB-2, Akt1, and Erk1/2 in premalignant mammary tissues. Also, lapatinib drastically inhibited the phosphorylation and expression of ERα and the transcription of ER target genes in premalignant mammary tissues. We also determined that lapatinib suppressed the stemness of breast cancer cell lines, as evidenced by decreased tumorsphere formation and ALDH(+) cell populations.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data demonstrate that brief treatment with EGFR/erbB-2-targeting agents before the onset of tumors may provide lifelong protection from mammary tumors, through the concurrent inhibition of erbB-2 and ER signaling pathways and consequential reprogramming. Our findings support further clinical testing to explore the benefit of shorter lapatinib exposure in the prevention of erbB-2-mediated carcinogenesis.	NA	0
28064387	The role of histone modifications and telomere alterations in the pathogenesis of diffuse gliomas in adults and children.	Genetic profiling is an increasingly useful tool for sub-classification of gliomas in adults and children. Specific gene mutations, structural rearrangements, DNA methylation patterns, and gene expression profiles are now recognized to define molecular subgroups of gliomas that arise in distinct anatomic locations and patient age groups, and also provide a better prediction of clinical outcomes for glioma patients compared to histologic assessment alone. Understanding the role of these distinctive genetic alterations in gliomagenesis is also important for the development of potential targeted therapeutic interventions. Mutations including K27M and G34R/V that affect critical amino acids within the N-terminal tail of the histone H3 variants, H3.3 and H3.1 (encoded by H3F3A and HIST1H3B genes), are prime examples of mutations in diffuse gliomas with characteristic clinical associations that can help diagnostic classification and guide effective patient management. These histone H3 mutations frequently co-occur with inactivating mutations in ATRX in association with alternative lengthening of telomeres. Telomere length can also be maintained through upregulation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression driven by mutation within the TERT gene promoter region, an alteration most commonly found in oligodendrogliomas and primary glioblastomas arising in adults. Interestingly, the genetic alterations perturbing histone and telomere function in pediatric gliomas tend to be different from those present in adult tumors. We present a review of these mutations affecting the histone code and telomere length, highlighting their importance in prognosis and as targets for novel therapeutics in the treatment of diffuse gliomas.

28063696	Association of post-treatment positron emission tomography with locoregional control and survival after radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the use of post-treatment F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for vulvar cancer and compare metabolic response to clinical outcomes.METHODS: This retrospective study included 21 patients with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma treated with curative-intent radiation between 2007 and 2015. All patients received intensity-modulated radiation treatment (IMRT), a pre-treatment FDG/PET-CT, and a post-treatment FDG-PET/CT performed at a median time of 3months post-IMRT.RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 28months. Post-treatment FDG-PET/CT demonstrated no evidence of disease (NED) in 12 patients and residual or progressive disease (PD) in 9. FDG-PET/CT response significantly correlated with biopsy-proven locoregional failure (p=0.02) and was the only significant factor associated with overall survival (OS) (p=0.049). Patients with NED on FDG-PET had a 2-year locoregional control (LRC) of 89% versus 25% for those with PD (p&lt;0.01). Patients with NED on FDG-PET/CT had a 2-year OS of 100% versus 42% for those with PD (p=0.02). FDG-PET/CT evaluation had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 71% for detecting pathologically proven residual disease in patients receiving neoadjuvant or definitive radiation.CONCLUSION: In this single-institution study of women with vulvar cancer, post-treatment response on FDG-PET/CT was associated with LRC and OS.

28063695	Ipsilateral axillary recurrence after breast conservative surgery: The protective effect of whole breast radiotherapy.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) is one of the possible reasons for the low rate of axillary recurrence after breast-conserving surgery (BCS).PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from 4,129 consecutive patients with breast cancer ⩽2cm and negative sentinel lymph node who underwent BCS between 1997 and 2007. We compared the risk of axillary lymph node recurrence between patients treated by WBRT (n=2939) and patients who received partial breast irradiation (PBI; n=1,190) performed by a single dose of electron intraoperative radiotherapy.RESULTS: Median tumour diameter was 1.1cm in both WBRT and PBI. Women who received WBRT were significantly younger and expressed significantly more multifocality, extensive in situ component, negative oestrogen receptor status and HER2 over-expression than women who received PBI. After a median follow-up of 8.3years, 37 and 28 axillary recurrences were observed in the WBRT and PBI arm, respectively, corresponding to a 10-year cumulative incidence of 1.3% and 4.0% (P&lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis resulted in a hazard ratio of 0.30 (95% CI 0.17-0.51) in favour of WBRT.CONCLUSIONS: In this large series of women with T1 breast cancer and negative sentinel lymph node treated by BCS, WBRT lowered the risk of axillary recurrence by two thirds as compared to PBI.

28063694	Post-WBRT cognitive impairment and hippocampal neuronal depletion measured by in vivo metabolic MR spectroscopy: Results of prospective investigational study.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate post-whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) changes in hippocampal concentration of N-acetylaspartate (h-tNAA) as a marker of neuronal loss and to correlate those changes to neurocognitive function.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients with brain metastases underwent baseline single slice multi-voxel MR spectroscopy (MRS) examination for measurement of hippocampal h-tNAA together with baseline battery of neurocognitive tests focused on memory (Auditory Verbal Learning Test and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Revised) as well as quality of life questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 a EORTC QLQ-BN20). Eighteen patients completed follow-up evaluation four months after standard WBRT (2 laterolateral fields, 10×3.0Gy, 6MV photons) and were included in this analysis. MRS and cognitive examinations were repeated and compared to baseline measurements.RESULTS: Statistically significant decreases in h-tNAA were observed in the right (8.52-7.42mM; -12.9%, 95%CI: -7.6 to -16.4%) as well as in the left hippocampus (8.64-7.60mM; -12%, 95%CI: -7.9 to -16.2%). Statistically significant decline was observed in all AVLT and BVMT-R subtests with exception of AVLT_Recognition. Quality of life declined after WBRT (mean Δ -14.1±20.3 points in transformed 0-100 point scale; p=0.018) with no correlation to changes in hippocampal metabolite concentrations. Moderate positive correlation was observed between left h-tNAA concentration decrease and AVLT_TR decline (r=+0.32; p=0.24) as well as with AVLT_DR (r=+0.33; p=0.22) decline. Changes in right h-tNAA/Cr negatively correlated with AVLT_DR (r=-0.48; p=0.061). No correlation between right hippocampus h-tNAA and memory decline (AVLT) was observed.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest hippocampal NAA concentrations decline after WBRT and MRS may be a useful biomarker for monitoring neuronal loss after radiotherapy.

28062087	Does an integrated boost increase acute toxicity in prone hypofractionated breast irradiation? A randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The safety of a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) in combination with prone hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (WBI) was investigated.MATERIALS AND METHODS: 167 patients were randomized between WBI with a sequential boost (SeB) or SIB. All patients were treated in prone position to 40.05Gy in 15 fractions to the whole breast. In the control arm, a SeB of 10Gy in 4 fractions (negative surgical margins) or 14.88Gy in 6 fractions (transsection) was prescribed. In the experimental arm a SIB of 46.8 or 49.95Gy (negative and positive surgical margins, respectively) was prescribed.RESULTS: Patient age was the only significantly different parameter between treatment arms with patients in the SIB arm being slightly older. In both arms, 6/83 patients developed moist desquamation. Grade 2/3 dermatitis was significantly more frequent in the SeB arm (38/83vs 24/83 patients, p=0.037). In the SIB and SeB arm, respectively, 36 patients (43%) and 51 patients (61%) developed pruritus (p=0.015). The incidence of oedema was lower in the SIB arm (59vs 68 patients), but not statistically significant (p=0.071).CONCLUSIONS: The primary endpoint, moist desquamation, was not significantly different between treatment arms.

28062086	Proton beam therapy for olfactory neuroblastoma.	PURPOSE: To clarify the efficacy and feasibility of proton beam therapy (PBT) for olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB).METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed 42 consecutive patients who received PBT with curative intent for ONB at National Cancer Center Hospital East from November 1999 to March 2012.RESULTS: Five patients (12%) had Kadish A disease, nine (21%) had Kadish B, and twenty-eight (67%) had Kadish C. All patients except one received a total dose of 65Gy (relative biological effectiveness: RBE) in 26 fractions. Twenty-four patients (57%) received induction and/or concurrent chemotherapy. The median follow-up for all eligible patients was 69months (7-186). The 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 100% and 80% for Kadish A, 86 and 65% for Kadish B, and 76% and 39% for Kadish C, respectively. The sites of the first progression were local in six patients (30%), regional in eight (40%), distant in two (10%), local and regional in two (10%), and local and distant in two (10%). Late adverse events of grade 3-4 were seen in six patients (ipsilateral visual impairment, 3; bilateral visual impairment, 1; liquorrhea, 1; cataract, 1).CONCLUSION: PBT was a safe and effective modality for ONB.

28068180	Clonal Hematopoiesis Associated With Adverse Outcomes After Autologous Stem-Cell Transplantation for Lymphoma.	Purpose Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an age-related condition characterized by somatic mutations in the blood of otherwise healthy adults. We hypothesized that in patients undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) for lymphoma, CHIP at the time of ASCT would be associated with an increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, collectively termed therapy-related myeloid neoplasm (TMN), and other adverse outcomes. Methods We performed whole-exome sequencing on pre- and post-ASCT samples from 12 patients who developed TMN after autologous transplantation for Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma and targeted sequencing on cryopreserved aliquots of autologous stem-cell products from 401 patients who underwent ASCT for non-Hodgkin lymphoma between 2003 and 2010. We assessed the effect of CHIP at the time of ASCT on subsequent outcomes, including TMN, cause-specific mortality, and overall survival. Results For six of 12 patients in the exome sequencing cohort, mutations found in the TMN specimen were also detectable in the pre-ASCT specimen. In the targeted sequencing cohort, 120 patients (29.9%) had CHIP at the time of ASCT, which was associated with an increased rate of TMN (10-year cumulative incidence, 14.1% v 4.3% for those with and without CHIP, respectively; P = .002). Patients with CHIP had significantly inferior overall survival compared with those without CHIP (10-year overall survival, 30.4% v 60.9%, respectively; P &lt; .001), including increased risk of death from TMN and cardiovascular disease. Conclusion In patients undergoing ASCT for lymphoma, CHIP at the time of transplantation is associated with inferior survival and increased risk of TMN.	NA	0
28068178	Cetuximab Plus Chemoradiotherapy in Immunocompetent Patients With Anal Carcinoma: A Phase II Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network Cancer Research Group Trial (E3205).	Purpose Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCAC) is characterized by high locoregional failure (LRF) rates after sphincter-preserving definitive chemoradiation (CRT) and is typically associated with anogenital human papilloma virus infection. Because cetuximab enhances the effect of radiation therapy in human papilloma virus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, we hypothesized that adding cetuximab to CRT would reduce LRF in SCCAC. Methods Sixty-one patients with stage I to III SCCAC received CRT including cisplatin, fluorouracil, and radiation therapy to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes (45 to 54 Gy) plus eight once-weekly doses of concurrent cetuximab. The study was designed to detect at least a 50% reduction in 3-year LRF rate (one-sided α, 0.10; power 90%), assuming a 35% LRF rate from historical data. Results Poor risk features included stage III disease in 64% and male sex in 20%. The 3-year LRF rate was 23% (95% CI, 13% to 36%; one-sided P = .03) by binomial proportional estimate using the prespecified end point and 21% (95% CI, 7% to 26%) by Kaplan-Meier estimate in a post hoc analysis using methods consistent with historical data. Three-year rates were 68% (95% CI, 55% to 79%) for progression-free survival and 83% (95% CI, 71% to 91%) for overall survival. Grade 4 toxicity occurred in 32%, and 5% had treatment-associated deaths. Conclusion Although the addition of cetuximab to chemoradiation for SCCAC was associated with lower LRF rates than historical data with CRT alone, toxicity was substantial, and LRF still occurs in approximately 20%, indicating the continued need for more effective and less toxic therapies.

28068177	Safety Profile of Nivolumab Monotherapy: A Pooled Analysis of Patients With Advanced Melanoma.	Purpose We conducted a retrospective analysis to assess the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma and describe the management of adverse events (AEs) using established safety guidelines. Patients and Methods Safety data were pooled from four studies, including two phase III trials, with patients who received nivolumab 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks. We evaluated rate of treatment-related AEs, time to onset and resolution of select AEs (those with potential immunologic etiology), and impact of select AEs and suppressive immune-modulating agents (IMs) on antitumor efficacy. Results Among 576 patients, 71% (95% CI, 67% to 75%) experienced any-grade treatment-related AEs (most commonly fatigue [25%], pruritus [17%], diarrhea [13%], and rash [13%]), and 10% (95% CI, 8% to 13%) experienced grade 3 to 4 treatment-related AEs. No drug-related deaths were reported. Select AEs (occurring in 49% of patients) were most frequently skin related, GI, endocrine, and hepatic; grade 3 to 4 select AEs occurred in 4% of patients. Median time to onset of select AEs ranged from 5 weeks for skin to 15 weeks for renal AEs. Approximately 24% of patients received systemic IMs to manage select AEs, which in most cases resolved. Adjusting for number of doses, objective response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in patients who experienced treatment-related select AEs of any grade compared with those who did not. ORRs were similar in patients who did and patients who did not receive systemic IMs. Conclusion Treatment-related AEs with nivolumab monotherapy were primarily low grade, and most resolved with established safety guidelines. Use of IMs did not affect ORR, although treatment-related select AEs of any grade were associated with higher ORR, but no progression-free survival benefit.	NA	0
28068175	CpG Methylation Signature Predicts Recurrence in Early-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Results From a Multicenter Study.	Purpose Early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (E-HCC) is being diagnosed increasingly, and in one half of diagnosed patients, recurrence will develop. Thus, it is urgent to identify recurrence-related markers. We investigated the effectiveness of CpG methylation in predicting recurrence for patients with E-HCCs. Patients and Methods In total, 576 patients with E-HCC from four independent centers were sorted by three phases. In the discovery phase, 66 tumor samples were analyzed using the Illumina Methylation 450k Beadchip. Two algorithms, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operation and Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination, were used to select significant CpGs. In the training phase, penalized Cox regression was used to further narrow CpGs into 140 samples. In the validation phase, candidate CpGs were validated using an internal cohort (n = 141) and two external cohorts (n = 191 and n =104). Results After combining the 46 CpGs selected by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operation and the Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination algorithms, three CpGs corresponding to SCAN domain containing 3, Src homology 3-domain growth factor receptor-bound 2-like interacting protein 1, and peptidase inhibitor 3 were highlighted as candidate predictors in the training phase. On the basis of the three CpGs, a methylation signature for E-HCC (MSEH) was developed to classify patients into high- and low-risk recurrence groups in the training cohort ( P &lt; .001). The performance of MSEH was validated in the internal cohort ( P &lt; .001) and in the two external cohorts ( P &lt; .001; P = .002). Furthermore, a nomogram comprising MSEH, tumor differentiation, cirrhosis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, and antivirus therapy was generated to predict the 5-year recurrence-free survival in the training cohort, and it performed well in the three validation cohorts (concordance index: 0.725, 0.697, and 0.693, respectively). Conclusion MSEH, a three-CpG-based signature, is useful in predicting recurrence for patients with E-HCC.	NA	0
28068172	Access to Accredited Cancer Hospitals Within Federal Exchange Plans Under the Affordable Care Act.	Purpose The Affordable Care Act expanded access to health insurance in the United States, but concerns have arisen about access to specialized cancer care within narrow provider networks. To characterize the scope and potential impact of this problem, we assessed rates of inclusion of Commission on Cancer (CoC) -accredited hospitals and National Cancer Institute (NCI) -designated cancer centers within federal exchange networks. Methods We downloaded publicly available machine-readable network data and public use files for individual federal exchange plans from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the 2016 enrollment year. We linked this information to National Provider Identifier data, identified a set of distinct provider networks, and assessed the rates of inclusion of CoC-accredited hospitals and NCI-designated centers. We measured variation in these rates according to geography, plan type, and metal level. Results Of 4,058 unique individual plans, network data were available for 3,637 (90%); hospital information was available for 3,531 (87%). Provider lists for these plans reduced into 295 unique networks for analysis. Ninety-five percent of networks included at least one CoC-accredited hospital, but just 41% of networks included NCI-designated centers. States and counties each varied substantially in the proportion of networks listed that included NCI-designated centers (range, 0% to 100%). The proportion of networks that included NCI-designated centers also varied by plan type (range, 31% for health maintenance organizations to 49% for preferred provider organizations; P = .04) but not by metal level. Conclusion A large majority of federal exchange networks contain CoC-accredited hospitals, but most do not contain NCI-designated cancer centers. These results will inform policy regarding access to cancer care, and they reinforce the importance of promoting access to clinical trials and specialized care through community sites.	NA	0
28068170	Factors Associated With Early Discontinuation of Study Treatment in the Mammary Prevention.3 Breast Cancer Chemoprevention Trial.	Purpose Aromatase inhibitors are established breast cancer chemoprevention interventions. However, nonadherence remains a significant challenge. We investigated the association between worsening menopause-specific quality of life, baseline participant characteristics, and early treatment discontinuation within the Mammary Prevention.3 (MAP.3) breast cancer prevention trial. Methods In the MAP.3 randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating exemestane, participants completed the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL) at entry and at 6 months. Multivariable log-binomial regression was used to assess the associations of baseline participant characteristics and clinically meaningful worsening in menopause-specific quality of life (QOL) with treatment discontinuation at 1 year. Results Of the 4,501 participants eligible for this analysis, 724 (17%) discontinued assigned treatment within the first year of random assignment of treatment (19% of the exemestane group and 13% of the placebo group). Between 19% and 35% of women experienced a clinically meaningful worsening in the vasomotor, sexual, physical, and psychosocial domains of the MENQOL within 6 months of treatment initiation. Regardless of receiving exemestane or not, experiencing a worsening in any MENQOL domain or, especially, overall menopause-specific QOL, was associated with early treatment discontinuation (relative risk, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.53 to 2.10 for overall worsening). Assignment to exemestane, having a smoking history, and current employment also were significantly associated with early discontinuation. Conclusion Negative changes in menopause-specific QOL influence a woman's decision to stop chemoprevention therapy. Attention to such symptoms may improve QOL and potentially improve chemoprevention adherence.	NA	0
28068435	Adaptive Optics Reveals Photoreceptor Abnormalities in Diabetic Macular Ischemia.	Diabetic macular ischemia (DMI) is a phenotype of diabetic retinopathy (DR) associated with chronic hypoxia of retinal tissue. The goal of this prospective observational study was to report evidence of photoreceptor abnormalities using adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) in eyes with DR in the setting of deep capillary plexus (DCP) non-perfusion. Eleven eyes from 11 patients (6 women, age 31-68), diagnosed with DR without macular edema, underwent optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and AOSLO imaging. One patient without OCTA imaging underwent fluorescein angiography to characterize the enlargement of the foveal avascular zone. The parameters studied included photoreceptor heterogeneity packing index (HPi) on AOSLO, as well as DCP non-perfusion and vessel density on OCTA. Using AOSLO, OCTA and spectral domain (SD)-OCT, we observed that photoreceptor abnormalities on AOSLO and SD-OCT were found in eyes with non-perfusion of the DCP on OCTA. All eight eyes with DCP non-flow on OCTA showed photoreceptor abnormalities on AOSLO. Six of the eight eyes also had outer retinal abnormalities on SD-OCT. Three eyes with DR and robust capillary perfusion of the DCP had normal photoreceptors on SD-OCT and AOSLO. Compared to eyes with DR without DCP non-flow, the eight eyes with DCP non-flow had significantly lower HPi (P = 0.013) and parafoveal DCP vessel density (P = 0.016). We found a significant correlation between cone HPi and parafoveal DCP vessel density (r = 0.681, P = 0.030). Using a novel approach with AOSLO and OCTA, this study shows an association between capillary non-perfusion of the DCP and abnormalities in the photoreceptor layer in eyes with DR. This observation is important in confirming the significant contribution of the DCP to oxygen requirements of photoreceptors in DMI, while highlighting the ability of AOSLO to detect subtle photoreceptor changes not always visible on SD-OCT.

28068434	Annexin/S100A Protein Family Regulation through p14ARF-p53 Activation: A Role in Cell Survival and Predicting Treatment Outcomes in Breast Cancer.	The annexin family and S100A associated proteins are important regulators of diverse calcium-dependent cellular processes including cell division, growth regulation and apoptosis. Dysfunction of individual annexin and S100A proteins is associated with cancer progression, metastasis and cancer drug resistance. This manuscript describes the novel finding of differential regulation of the annexin and S100A family of proteins by activation of p53 in breast cancer cells. Additionally, the observed differential regulation is found to be beneficial to the survival of breast cancer cells and to influence treatment efficacy. We have used unbiased, quantitative proteomics to determine the proteomic changes occurring post p14ARF-p53 activation in estrogen receptor (ER) breast cancer cells. In this report we identified differential regulation of the annexin/S100A family, through unique peptide recognition at the N-terminal regions, demonstrating p14ARF-p53 is a central orchestrator of the annexin/S100A family of calcium regulators in favor of pro-survival functions in the breast cancer cell. This regulation was found to be cell-type specific. Retrospective human breast cancer studies have demonstrated that tumors with functional wild type p53 (p53wt) respond poorly to some chemotherapy agents compared to tumors with a non-functional p53. Given that modulation of calcium signaling has been demonstrated to change sensitivity of chemotherapeutic agents to apoptotic signals, in principle, we explored the paradigm of how p53 modulation of calcium regulators in ER+ breast cancer patients impacts and influences therapeutic outcomes.

28068431	CIL-102-Induced Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis in Colorectal Cancer Cells via Upregulation of p21 and GADD45.	CIL-102 (1-[4-(furo[2,3-b]quinolin-4-ylamino)phenyl]ethanone) is a well-known, major active agent of the alkaloid derivative of Camptotheca acuminata with valuable biological properties, including anti-tumorigenic activity. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which CIL-102 mediated the induction of cell death, and we performed cell cycle G2/M arrest to clarify molecular changes in colorectal cancer cells (CRC). Treatment of DLD-1 cells with CIL-102 resulted in triggering the extrinsic apoptosis pathway through the activation of Fas-L, caspase-8 and the induction of Bid cleavage and cytochrome c release in a time-dependent manner. In addition, CIL-102 mediated apoptosis and G2/M arrest by phosphorylation of the Jun N-terminus kinase (JNK1/2) signaling pathway. This resulted in the expression of NFκB p50, p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) levels, and in the induction of p21 and GADD45 as well as the decreased association of cdc2/cyclin B. Furthermore, treatment with the JNK1/2 (SP600125), NFκB (PDTI) or the p300/CBP (C646) inhibitors abolished CIL-102-induced cell cycle G2/M arrest and reversed the association of cdc2 with cyclin B. Therefore, we demonstrated that there was an increase in the cellular levels of p21 and GADD45 by CIL-102 reduction in cell viability and cell cycle arrest via the activation of the JNK1/2, NFκB p50, p300 and CBP signaling modules. Collectively, our results demonstrated that CIL-102 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of colon cancer cells by upregulating p21 and GADD45 expression and by activating JNK1/2, NFκB p50 and p300 to provide a new mechanism for CIL-102 treatment.

28068430	Molecular Mimics of Classic P-Glycoprotein Inhibitors as Multidrug Resistance Suppressors and Their Synergistic Effect on Paclitaxel.	P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is a membrane bound efflux pump spread in a variety of tumor cells and considered as a main component of multidrug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapies. In this work, three groups of compounds (imidazolone, oxazolone and vinyl dipeptide derivatives) were synthesized aiming to develop a molecular framework that effectively suppresses MDR. When tested for their influence on Pgp activity, four compounds coded Cur1-01, Cur1-12V, Curox-1 and Curox-3 significantly decreased remaining ATP concentration indicating Pgp substrate site blocking. On the other hand, Cur-3 and Cur-10 significantly increased remaining ATP concentration, which is indicative of Pgp ATPase inhibition. The cytotoxicity of synthesized compounds was examined against Pgp expressing/highly resistant colorectal cancer cell lines (LS-174T). Compounds Cur-1 and Cur-3 showed considerable cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 7.6 and 8.9 μM, respectively. Equitoxic combination (at IC50 concentrations) of PTX and Cur-3 greatly diminished resistant cell clone from 45.7% to 2.5%, albeit with some drop in potency from IC50 of 7.9 nM to IC50 of 23.8 nM. On the other hand, combination of PTX and the non-cytotoxic Cur1-12V (10 μM) significantly decreased the IC50 of PTX to 3.8 nM as well as the resistant fraction to 16.2%. The combination test was confirmed using the same protocol but on another resistant CRC cell line (HCT-116) as we obtained similar results. Both Cur-3 and Cur1-12V (10 μM) significantly increased the cellular entrapment of Pgp probe (doxorubicin) elevating its intracellular concentration from 1.9 pmole/cell to 3.0 and 2.9 pmole/cell, respectively.

28068409	Reprogramming Malignant Cancer Cells toward a Benign Phenotype following Exposure to Human Embryonic Stem Cell Microenvironment.	The embryonic microenvironment is well known to be non-permissive for tumor development because early developmental signals naturally suppress the expression of proto-oncogenes. In an analogous manner, mimicking an early embryonic environment during embryonic stem cell culture has been shown to suppress oncogenic phenotypes of cancer cells. Exosomes derived from human embryonic stem cells harbor substances that mirror the content of the cells of origin and have been reported to reprogram hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells via horizontal transfer of mRNA and proteins. However, the possibility that these embryonic stem cells-derived exosomes might be the main effectors of the anti-tumor effect mediated by the embryonic stem cells has not been explored yet. The present study aims to investigate whether exosomes derived from human embryonic stem cells can reprogram malignant cancer cells to a benign stage and reduce their tumorigenicity. We show that the embryonic stem cell-conditioned medium contains factors that inhibit cancer cell growth and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate that exosomes derived from human embryonic stem cells display anti-proliferation and pro-apoptotic effects, and decrease tumor size in a xenograft model. These exosomes are also able to transfer their cargo into target cancer cells, inducing a dose-dependent increase in SOX2, OCT4 and Nanog proteins, leading to a dose-dependent decrease of cancer cell growth and tumorigenicity. This study shows for the first time that human embryonic stem cell-derived exosomes play an important role in the tumor suppressive activity displayed by human embryonic stem cells.	NA	0
28068382	The Impact of Pre-Operative Breast MRI on Surgical Waiting Time.	PURPOSE: To assess the impact of pre-operative breast MRI on surgical waiting time, and to identify factors contributing to the delay.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study involving 1274 patients was conducted after obtaining institutional ethics review. Surgical candidates for newly diagnosed breast cancer from 2007 to 2013 at a tertiary center were divided into 2 groups: those who had pre-operative MRI and those who did not. Linear regression using matched populations was used to compare the surgical waiting times, defined as time from the date of the first positive biopsy to the date of surgery. Potential influences on surgical waiting time and subgroup analysis were obtained using median regression analysis and the Kruskal-Wallis test.RESULTS: Mean surgical waiting time was 57.9 days (95% CI: 55.6-60.1) for MRI patients, compared to 46.8 days (95% CI: 45.1-48.9) for the control group, after matching for potential confounding factors (p&lt;0.0001). Increased surgical waiting time was associated with more favorable pathology, later year of diagnosis, older patient age, surgeon and summer time. Second-look ultrasound and subsequent biopsies were associated with increased waiting time (p = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative breast MRI increased surgical waiting time by 11 days using a conventional average of differences, and by 12 days after using a full matching statistical method (p&lt;0.0001), with the main contributor being additional post-MRI procedures and imaging.

28068369	Comparable Outcomes of Ultrasound versus Computed Tomography in the Guidance of Radiofrequency Ablation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.	OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) in the guidance of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed consecutive treatment-naïve patients who received curative RFA for HCC from January 2008 to July 2013. Patients were divided into the US group or the CT group according to their RFA guidance instruments. Patients who were only suitable for US- or CT-guided RFA were excluded. Cumulative incidences of and hazard ratios for HCC recurrence were analyzed after adjusting for competing mortality risk.RESULTS: We recruited a total of 101 patients in the US group and 51 patients in the CT group. The baseline demographic characteristics were not significantly different in both groups. Initial response rates were similar between the two groups (US vs. CT: 89.1% vs. 92.2%, p = 0.54), and complete tumor ablation was finally achieved for all patients. However, more ablations per session were performed in US group (median 2.0 [1.0-3.0] vs. 1.0 [1.0-2.0]; p&lt;0.01). The 1-, 2- and 3-year local tumor recurrence rates (US vs. CT: 13.0%, 20.9%, and 29.2% vs. 11.2%, 29.8% and 29.8%, respectively) and overall mortality rates (US vs. CT: 5.2%, 9.6% and 16.5% vs. 0%, 3.1% and 23.8%, respectively) were not significantly different. In multivariate analysis, tumor characteristics and underlying liver function, but not US or CT guidance, were independent prognostic factors. The complication rates were similar between the two groups (US vs. CT: 10.9% vs. 9.8%; p = 0.71), and there was no procedure-related mortality.CONCLUSIONS: With comparable major outcomes, either US or CT can be used in the guidance of RFA in experience hands.

28068367	Cell-Surface Integrins and CAR Are Both Essential for Adenovirus Type 5 Transduction of Canine Cells of Lymphocytic Origin.	Adenoviruses are the most widely used vectors in cancer gene therapy. Adenoviruses vectors are well characterized and are easily manipulated. Adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) is the most commonly used human serotype. Ad5 internalization into host cells is a combined effect of binding of Ad5 fiber knob with the coxsackie virus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) and binding of RGD motifs in viral penton to cell surface integrins (αvβ3, αvβ5). Ad5's wide range of host-cell transduction and lack of integration into the host genome have made it an excellent choice for cancer therapeutics. However, Ad5 has limited ability to transduce cells of hematopoietic origin. It has been previously reported that low or no expression of CAR is a potential obstacle to Ad5 infection in hematopoietic origin cells. In addition, we have previously reported that low levels of cell surface integrins (αvβ3, αvβ5) may inhibit Ad5 infection in canine lymphoma cell lines. In the current report we have examined the ability of an Ad5 vector to infect human (HEK293) and canine non-cancerous (NCF and PBMC), canine non-hematopoietic origin cancer (CMT28, CML7, and CML10), and canine hematopoietic origin cancer (DH82, 17-71, OSW, MPT-1, and BR) cells. In addition, we have quantified CAR, αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrin transcript expression in these cells by using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (q-RT-PCR). Low levels of integrins were present in MPT1, 17-71, OSW, and PBMC cells in comparison to CMT28, DH82, and BR cells. CAR mRNA levels were comparatively higher in MPT1, 17-71, OSW, and PBMC cells. This report confirms and expands the finding that low or absent expression of cell surface integrins may be the primary reason for the inability of Ad5-based vectors to transduce cells of lymphocytic origin and some myeloid cells but this is not true for all hematopoietic origin cells. For efficient use of Ad5-based therapeutic vectors in cancers of lymphocytic origin, it is important to address the defects in cell surface integrins.	NA	0
28068363	Quantitative Computed Tomography Features for Predicting Tumor Recurrence in Patients with Surgically Resected Adenocarcinoma of the Lung.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine if preoperative quantitative computed tomography (CT) features including texture and histogram analysis measurements are associated with tumor recurrence in patients with surgically resected adenocarcinoma of the lung.METHODS: The study included 194 patients with surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma who underwent preoperative CT between January 2013 and December 2013. Quantitative CT feature analysis of the lung adenocarcinomas were performed using in-house software based on plug-in package for ImageJ. Ten quantitative features demonstrating the tumor size, attenuation, shape and texture were extracted. The CT parameters obtained from 1-mm and 5-mm data were compared using intraclass correlation coefficients. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to investigate the association between tumor recurrence and preoperative CT findings.RESULTS: The 1-mm and 5-mm data were highly correlated in terms of diameter, perimeter, area, mean attenuation and entropy. Circularity and aspect ratio were moderately correlated. However, skewness and kurtosis were poorly correlated. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that area (odds ratio [OR], 1.002 for each 1-mm2 increase; P = 0.003) and mean attenuation (OR, 1.005 for each 1.0-Hounsfield unit increase; P = 0.022) were independently associated with recurrence. The receiver operating curves using these two independent predictive factors showed high diagnostic performance in predicting recurrence (C-index = 0.81, respectively).CONCLUSION: Tumor area and mean attenuation are independently associated with recurrence in patients with surgically resected adenocarcinoma of the lung.

28068360	Exploring Serum Levels of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Nerve Growth Factor Across Glaucoma Stages.	PURPOSE: To investigate the serum levels of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) in patients affected by primary open angle glaucoma with a wide spectrum of disease severity compared to healthy controls and to explore their relationship with morphological and functional glaucoma parameters.MATERIALS AND METHODS: 45 patients affected by glaucoma at different stages and 15 age-matched healthy control subjects underwent visual field testing, peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness measurement using Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography and blood collection for both neurotrophins detection by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay. Statistical analysis and association between biostrumental and biochemical data were investigated.RESULTS: Serum levels of BDNF in glaucoma patients were significantly lower than those measured in healthy controls (261.2±75.0 pg/ml vs 313.6±79.6 pg/ml, p = 0.03). Subgroups analysis showed that serum levels of BDNF were significantly lower in early (253.8±40.7 pg/ml, p = 0.019) and moderate glaucoma (231.3±54.3 pg/ml, p = 0.04) but not in advanced glaucoma (296.2±103.1 pg/ml, p = 0.06) compared to healthy controls. Serum levels of NGF in glaucoma patients were significantly lower than those measured in the healthy controls (4.1±1 pg/mL vs 5.5±1.2 pg/mL, p = 0.01). Subgroups analysis showed that serum levels of NGF were significantly lower in early (3.5±0.9 pg/mL, p = 0.0008) and moderate glaucoma (3.8±0.7 pg/ml, p&lt;0.0001) but not in advanced glaucoma (5.0±0.7 pg/ml, p = 0.32) compared to healthy controls. BDNF serum levels were not related to age, visual field mean deviation or retinal nerve fibre layer thickness either in glaucoma or in controls while NGF levels were significantly related to visual field mean deviation in the glaucoma group (r2 = 0.26, p = 0.004).CONCLUSIONS: BDNF and NGF serum levels are reduced in the early and moderate glaucoma stages, suggesting the possibility that both factors could be further investigated as potential circulating biomarkers for the early detection of glaucoma.

28068355	A Methodology for Cancer Therapeutics by Systems Pharmacology-Based Analysis: A Case Study on Breast Cancer-Related Traditional Chinese Medicines.	Breast cancer is the most common carcinoma in women. Comprehensive therapy on breast cancer including surgical operation, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrinotherapy, etc. could help, but still has serious side effect and resistance against anticancer drugs. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) may avoid these problems, in which traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been highlighted. In this section, to analyze the mechanism through which TCM act on breast cancer, we have built a virtual model consisting of the construction of database, oral bioavailability prediction, drug-likeness evaluation, target prediction, network construction. The 20 commonly employed herbs for the treatment of breast cancer were used as a database to carry out research. As a result, 150 ingredient compounds were screened out as active molecules for the herbs, with 33 target proteins predicted. Our analysis indicates that these herbs 1) takes a 'Jun-Chen-Zuo-Shi&quot; as rule of prescription, 2) which function mainly through perturbing three pathways involving the epidermal growth factor receptor, estrogen receptor, and inflammatory pathways, to 3) display the breast cancer-related anti-estrogen, anti-inflammatory, regulation of cell metabolism and proliferation activities. To sum it up, by providing a novel in silico strategy for investigation of the botanical drugs, this work may be of some help for understanding the action mechanisms of herbal medicines and for discovery of new drugs from plants.

28068351	Phenotype and Tissue Expression as a Function of Genetic Risk in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.	Genome-wide association studies and replication analyses have identified (n = 5) or replicated (n = 10) DNA variants associated with risk for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in European women. However, the causal gene and underlying mechanism for PCOS risk at these loci have not been determined. We hypothesized that analysis of phenotype, gene expression and metformin response as a function of genotype would identify candidate genes and pathways that could provide insight into the underlying mechanism for risk at these loci. To test the hypothesis, subjects with PCOS (n = 427) diagnosed according to the NIH criteria (&lt; 9 menses per year and clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism) and controls (n = 407) with extensive phenotyping were studied. A subset of subjects (n = 38) underwent a subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy for RNA sequencing and were subsequently treated with metformin for 12 weeks with standardized outcomes measured. Data were analyzed according to genotype at PCOS risk loci and adjusted for the false discovery rate. A gene variant in the THADA locus was associated with response to metformin and metformin was a predicted upstream regulator at the same locus. Genotype at the FSHB locus was associated with LH levels. Genes near the PCOS risk loci demonstrated differences in expression as a function of genotype in adipose including BLK and NEIL2 (GATA4 locus), GLIPR1 and PHLDA1 (KRR1 locus). Based on the phenotypes, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and upstream regulatory and pathway analyses we hypothesize that there are PCOS subtypes. FSHB, FHSR and LHR loci may influence PCOS risk based on their relationship to gonadotropin levels. The THADA, GATA4, ERBB4, SUMO1P1, KRR1 and RAB5B loci appear to confer risk through metabolic mechanisms. The IRF1, SUMO1P1 and KRR1 loci may confer PCOS risk in development. The TOX3 and GATA4 loci appear to be involved in inflammation and its consequences. The data suggest potential PCOS subtypes and point to the need for additional studies to replicate these findings and identify personalized diagnosis and treatment options for PCOS.	NA	0
28068672	Genomic hallmarks of localized, non-indolent prostate cancer.	Prostate tumours are highly variable in their response to therapies, but clinically available prognostic factors can explain only a fraction of this heterogeneity. Here we analysed 200 whole-genome sequences and 277 additional whole-exome sequences from localized, non-indolent prostate tumours with similar clinical risk profiles, and carried out RNA and methylation analyses in a subset. These tumours had a paucity of clinically actionable single nucleotide variants, unlike those seen in metastatic disease. Rather, a significant proportion of tumours harboured recurrent non-coding aberrations, large-scale genomic rearrangements, and alterations in which an inversion repressed transcription within its boundaries. Local hypermutation events were frequent, and correlated with specific genomic profiles. Numerous molecular aberrations were prognostic for disease recurrence, including several DNA methylation events, and a signature comprised of these aberrations outperformed well-described prognostic biomarkers. We suggest that intensified treatment of genomically aggressive localized prostate cancer may improve cure rates.	NA	1
28068668	The Hippo kinases LATS1 and 2 control human breast cell fate via crosstalk with ERα.	Cell fate perturbations underlie many human diseases, including breast cancer. Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which breast cell fate are regulated are largely unknown. The mammary gland epithelium consists of differentiated luminal epithelial and basal myoepithelial cells, as well as undifferentiated stem cells and more restricted progenitors. Breast cancer originates from this epithelium, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie breast epithelial hierarchy remain ill-defined. Here, we use a high-content confocal image-based short hairpin RNA screen to identify tumour suppressors that regulate breast cell fate in primary human breast epithelial cells. We show that ablation of the large tumour suppressor kinases (LATS) 1 and 2 (refs 5, 6), which are part of the Hippo pathway, promotes the luminal phenotype and increases the number of bipotent and luminal progenitors, the proposed cells-of-origin of most human breast cancers. Mechanistically, we have identified a direct interaction between Hippo and oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) signalling. In the presence of LATS, ERα was targeted for ubiquitination and Ddb1-cullin4-associated-factor 1 (DCAF1)-dependent proteasomal degradation. Absence of LATS stabilized ERα and the Hippo effectors YAP and TAZ (hereafter YAP/TAZ), which together control breast cell fate through intrinsic and paracrine mechanisms. Our findings reveal a non-canonical (that is, YAP/TAZ-independent) effect of LATS in the regulation of human breast cell fate.	NA	0
28067901	Targeting SAMHD1 with the Vpx protein to improve cytarabine therapy for hematological malignancies.	The cytostatic deoxycytidine analog cytarabine (ara-C) is the most active agent available against acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Together with anthracyclines, ara-C forms the backbone of AML treatment for children and adults. In AML, both the cytotoxicity of ara-C in vitro and the clinical response to ara-C therapy are correlated with the ability of AML blasts to accumulate the active metabolite ara-C triphosphate (ara-CTP), which causes DNA damage through perturbation of DNA synthesis. Differences in expression levels of known transporters or metabolic enzymes relevant to ara-C only partially account for patient-specific differential ara-CTP accumulation in AML blasts and response to ara-C treatment. Here we demonstrate that the deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) triphosphohydrolase SAM domain and HD domain 1 (SAMHD1) promotes the detoxification of intracellular ara-CTP pools. Recombinant SAMHD1 exhibited ara-CTPase activity in vitro, and cells in which SAMHD1 expression was transiently reduced by treatment with the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) protein Vpx were dramatically more sensitive to ara-C-induced cytotoxicity. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated disruption of the gene encoding SAMHD1 sensitized cells to ara-C, and this sensitivity could be abrogated by ectopic expression of wild-type (WT), but not dNTPase-deficient, SAMHD1. Mouse models of AML lacking SAMHD1 were hypersensitive to ara-C, and treatment ex vivo with Vpx sensitized primary patient-derived AML blasts to ara-C. Finally, we identified SAMHD1 as a risk factor in cohorts of both pediatric and adult patients with de novo AML who received ara-C treatment. Thus, SAMHD1 expression levels dictate patient sensitivity to ara-C, providing proof-of-concept that the targeting of SAMHD1 by Vpx could be an attractive therapeutic strategy for potentiating ara-C efficacy in hematological malignancies.	therapeutic	1
28067900	Donor CD19 CAR T cells exert potent graft-versus-lymphoma activity with diminished graft-versus-host activity.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for hematological malignancies. However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and relapse after allo-HSCT remain major impediments to the success of allo-HSCT. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) direct tumor cell recognition of adoptively transferred T cells. CD19 is an attractive CAR target, which is expressed in most B cell malignancies, as well as in healthy B cells. Clinical trials using autologous CD19-targeted T cells have shown remarkable promise in various B cell malignancies. However, the use of allogeneic CAR T cells poses a concern in that it may increase risk of the occurrence of GVHD, although this has not been reported in selected patients infused with donor-derived CD19 CAR T cells after allo-HSCT. To understand the mechanism whereby allogeneic CD19 CAR T cells may mediate anti-lymphoma activity without causing a significant increase in the incidence of GVHD, we studied donor-derived CD19 CAR T cells in allo-HSCT and lymphoma models in mice. We demonstrate that alloreactive T cells expressing CD28-costimulated CD19 CARs experience enhanced stimulation, resulting in the progressive loss of both their effector function and proliferative potential, clonal deletion, and significantly decreased occurrence of GVHD. Concurrently, the other CAR T cells that were present in bulk donor T cell populations retained their anti-lymphoma activity in accordance with the requirement that both the T cell receptor (TCR) and CAR be engaged to accelerate T cell exhaustion. In contrast, first-generation and 4-1BB-costimulated CAR T cells increased the occurrence of GVHD. These findings could explain the reduced risk of GVHD occurring with cumulative TCR and CAR signaling.	NA	0
28068330	Loss of p53 induces leukemic transformation in a murine model of Jak2 V617F-driven polycythemia vera.	As leukemic transformation of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) worsens the clinical outcome, reducing the inherent risk of the critical event in MPN cases could be beneficial. Among genetic alterations concerning the transformation, the frequent one is TP53 mutation. Here we show that retroviral overexpression of Jak2 V617F mutant into wild-type p53 murine bone marrow cells induced polycythemia vera (PV) in the recipient mice, whereas Jak2 V617F-transduced p53-null mice developed lethal leukemia after the preceding PV phase. The leukemic mice had severe anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary hemorrhage and expansion of dysplastic erythroid progenitors. Primitive leukemia cells (c-kit(+)Sca1(+)Lin(-) (KSL) and CD34(-)CD16/32(-)c-kit(+)Sca1(-)Lin(-) (megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor; MEP)) and erythroid progenitors (CD71(+)) from Jak2 V617F-transduced p53-null leukemic mice had leukemia-initiating capacity, however, myeloid differentiated populations (Mac-1(+)) could not recapitulate the disease. Interestingly, recipients transplanted with CD71(+) cells rapidly developed erythroid leukemia, which was in sharp contrast to leukemic KSL cells to cause lethal leukemia after the polycythemic state. The leukemic CD71(+) cells were more sensitive to INCB18424, a potent JAK inhibitor, than KSL cells. p53 restoration could ameliorate Jak2 V617F-transduced p53-null erythroleukemia. Taken together, our results show that p53 loss is sufficient for inducing leukemic transformation in Jak2 V617F-positive MPN.Oncogene advance online publication, 9 January 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.478.	prognostic	1
28068329	The primacy of NF1 loss as the driver of tumorigenesis in neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas.	Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common tumor-predisposition disorder due to germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1. A virtually pathognomonic finding of NF1 is the plexiform neurofibroma (PN), a benign, likely congenital tumor that arises from bi-allelic inactivation of NF1. PN can undergo transformation to a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, an aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma. To better understand the non-NF1 genetic contributions to PN pathogenesis, we performed whole-exome sequencing, RNASeq profiling and genome-wide copy-number determination for 23 low-passage Schwann cell cultures established from surgical PN material with matching germline DNA. All resected tumors were derived from routine debulking surgeries. None of the tumors were considered at risk for malignant transformation at the time; for example, there was no pain or rapid growth. Deep (~500X) NF1 exon sequencing was also conducted on tumor DNA. Non-NF1 somatic mutation verification was performed using the Ampliseq/IonTorrent platform. We identified 100% of the germline NF1 mutations and found somatic NF1 inactivation in 74% of the PN. One individual with three PNs had different NF1 somatic mutations in each tumor. The median number of somatic mutations per sample, including NF1, was one (range 0-8). NF1 was the only gene that was recurrently somatically inactivated in multiple tumors. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of transcriptome-wide tumor RNA sequencing identified five significant (FDR&lt;0.01) and seven trending (0.01⩽FDR&lt;0.02) gene sets related to DNA replication, telomere maintenance and elongation, cell cycle progression, signal transduction and cell proliferation. We found no recurrent non-NF1 locus copy-number variation in PN. This is the first multi-sample whole-exome and whole-transcriptome sequencing study of NF1-associated PN. Taken together with concurrent copy-number data, our comprehensive genetic analysis reveals the primacy of NF1 loss as the driver of PN tumorigenesis.Oncogene advance online publication, 9 January 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.464.

28068328	MLL-ENL-mediated leukemia initiation at the interface of lymphoid commitment.	Translocations involving the mixed lineage leukemia-1 are recurrent events in acute leukemia and associate with lymphoid (ALL), myeloid (AML) or mixed lineage (MLL) subtypes. Despite an association with ALL in humans, murine MLL fusion models are persistently restricted to AML. We here explored this issue using an inducible mixed lineage leukemia-eleven nineteen leukemia (MLL-ENL) mouse model. Although multiple progenitor cell types with myeloid potential are potent AML leukemia-initiating cells, also the earliest lymphoid progenitors were capable of initiating AML. This ability to evoke a latent myeloid potential in the earliest lymphoid progenitors was lost upon further lymphoid commitment. At the same time, more downstream/committed lymphoid precursors also failed to initiate lymphoid leukemia. Co-expression of MLL-ENL with a constitutively active RAS allele, the most common co-mutation in MLL fusion leukemias, could influence on both disease latency and lineage assignment of developing leukemia in what appears to be a mutation-order-dependent manner. Finally, CEBPB-mediated transdifferentation of committed and otherwise leukemia-incompetent B-cell progenitors imbued these cells with leukemic competence for AML. Therefore, apart from providing detailed insight into the differential responsiveness of candidate target cells to a first-hit MLL fusion event, our data warrants caution to therapeutic approaches based on the concept of transdifferentiation.Oncogene advance online publication, 9 January 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.470.

28068326	KLF4 is regulated by RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling through E2F1 and promotes melanoma cell growth.	Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer and treatment of metastatic melanoma remains challenging. BRAF/MEK inhibitors show only temporary benefit due the occurrence of resistance and immunotherapy is effective only in a subset of patients. To improve patient survival, there is a need to better understand molecular mechanisms that drive melanoma growth and operate downstream of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. The Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays a critical role in embryonic development, stemness and cancer, where it can act either as oncogene or tumor suppressor. KLF4 is highly expressed in post-mitotic epidermal cells, but its role in melanoma remains unknown. Here, we address the function of KLF4 in melanoma and its interaction with the MAPK signaling pathway. We find that KLF4 is highly expressed in a subset of human melanomas. Ectopic expression of KLF4 enhances melanoma cell growth by decreasing apoptosis. Conversely, knock-down of KLF4 reduces melanoma cell proliferation and induces cell death. In addition, depletion of KLF4 reduces melanoma xenograft growth in vivo. We find that the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling positively modulates KLF4 expression through the transcription factor E2F1, which directly binds to KLF4 promoter. Overall, our data demonstrate the pro-tumorigenic role of KLF4 in melanoma and uncover a novel ERK1/2-E2F1-KLF4 axis. These findings identify KLF4 as a possible new molecular target for designing novel therapeutic treatments to control melanoma growth.Oncogene advance online publication, 9 January 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.481.

28068325	TRIM28 interacts with EZH2 and SWI/SNF to activate genes that promote mammosphere formation.	Histone methyl transferase EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2) is generally associated with H3K27 methylation and gene silencing, as a member of the polycomb repressor 2 (PRC2) complex. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry of the EZH2-protein interactome in estrogen receptor positive, breast cancer-derived MCF7 cells revealed EZH2 interactions with subunits of chromatin remodeler SWI/SNF complex and TRIM28, which formed a complex with EZH2 distinct from PRC2. Unexpectedly, transcriptome profiling showed that EZH2 primarily activates, rather than represses, transcription in MCF7 cells and with TRIM28 co-regulates a set of genes associated with stem cell maintenance and poor survival of breast cancer patients. TRIM28 depletion repressed EZH2 recruitment to chromatin and expression of this gene set, in parallel with decreased CD44(hi)/CD24(lo) mammosphere formation. Mammosphere formation, inhibited by EZH2 depletion, was rescued by ectopic expression of EZH2 but not by TRIM28 expression or by EZH2 mutated at the region (pre-SET domain) of TRIM28 interaction. These results support PRC2-independent functions of EZH2 and TRIM28 in activation of gene expression that promotes mammary stem cell enrichment and maintenance.Oncogene advance online publication, 9 January 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.453.

28068324	Role of Akt2 in regulation of metastasis suppressor 1 expression and colorectal cancer metastasis.	Survival signaling is critical for the metastatic program of cancer cells. The current study investigated the role of Akt survival proteins in colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis and explored potential mechanisms of Akt-mediated metastasis regulation. Using an orthotopic implantation model in mice, which uniquely recapitulates the entire multistep process of CRC metastasis, combined with an inducible system of short hairpin RNA-mediated Akt isoform knockdown in human CRC cells, our studies confirm a role of Akt2 in CRC cell dissemination to distant organs in vivo. Akt2 deficiency profoundly inhibited the development of liver lesions in mice, whereas Akt1 had no effect under the experimental conditions used in the study. Array analysis of human metastatic genes identified the scaffolding protein metastasis suppressor 1 (MTSS1) as a novel Akt2-regulated gene. Inducible loss of Akt2 in CRC cells robustly upregulated MTSS1 at the messenger RNA and protein level, and the accumulated protein was functionally active as shown by its ability to engage an MTSS1-Src-cortactin inhibitory axis. MTSS1 expression led to a marked reduction in levels of functional cortacin (pcortactin Y421), an actin nucleation-promoting factor that has a crucial role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. MTSS1 was also shown to mediate suppressive effects of Akt2 deficiency on CRC cell viability, survival, migration and actin polymerization in vitro. The relevance of these findings to human CRC is supported by analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and NCBI GEO data sets, which demonstrated inverse changes in expression of Akt2 and MTSS1 during CRC progression. Taken together, the data identify MTSS1 as a new Akt2-regulated gene, and point to suppression of MTSS1 as a key step in the metastasis-promoting effects of Akt2 in CRC cells.Oncogene advance online publication, 9 January 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.460.

28068323	The Nogo-B receptor promotes Ras plasma membrane localization and activation.	The localization of prenylated Ras at the plasma membrane promotes activation of Ras by receptor tyrosine kinases and stimulates oncogenic signaling by mutant Ras. The Nogo-B receptor (NgBR) is a transmembrane receptor that contains a conserved hydrophobic pocket. Here, we demonstrate that the NgBR promotes the membrane accumulation of Ras by directly binding prenylated Ras at the plasma membrane. We show that NgBR knockdown diminishes the membrane localization of Ras in multiple cell types. NgBR overexpression in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts increases membrane-associated Ras, induces the transformed phenotype in vitro, and promotes the formation of fibrosarcoma in nude mice. NgBR knockdown in human breast cancer cells reduces Ras membrane localization, inhibits epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated Ras signaling and diminishes tumorigenesis of xenografts in nude mice. Our data demonstrate that NgBR is a unique receptor that promotes accumulation of prenylated Ras at the plasma membrane and promotes EGF pathways.Oncogene advance online publication, 9 January 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.484.

28068322	Role of the PDZ-scaffold protein NHERF1/EBP50 in cancer biology: from signaling regulation to clinical relevance.	The transmission of cellular information requires fine and subtle regulation of proteins that need to interact in a coordinated and specific way to form efficient signaling networks. The spatial and temporal coordination relies on scaffold proteins. Thanks to protein interaction domains such as PDZ domains, scaffold proteins organize multiprotein complexes enabling the proper transmission of cellular information through intracellular networks. NHERF1/EBP50 is a PDZ-scaffold protein that was initially identified as an organizer and regulator of transporters and channels at the apical side of epithelia through actin-binding ezrin-moesin-radixin proteins. Since, NHERF1/EBP50 has emerged as a major regulator of cancer signaling network by assembling cancer-related proteins. The PDZ-scaffold EBP50 carries either anti-tumor or pro-tumor functions, two antinomic functions dictated by EBP50 expression or subcellular localization. The dual function of NHERF1/EBP50 encompasses the regulation of several major signaling pathways engaged in cancer, including the receptor tyrosine kinases PDGFR and EGFR, PI3K/PTEN/AKT and Wnt-β-catenin pathways.Oncogene advance online publication, 9 January 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.462.

28068321	Analysis of DNA methylation in single circulating tumor cells.	Direct analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can inform on molecular mechanisms underlying systemic spread. Here we investigated promoter methylation of three genes regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key mechanism enabling epithelial tumor cells to disseminate and metastasize. For this, we developed a single-cell protocol based on agarose-embedded bisulfite treatment, which allows investigating DNA methylation of multiple loci via a multiplex PCR (multiplexed-scAEBS). We established our assay for the simultaneous analysis of three EMT-associated genes miR-200c/141, miR-200b/a/429 and CDH1 in single cells. The assay was validated in solitary cells of GM14667, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines, achieving a DNA amplification efficiency of 70% with methylation patterns identical to the respective bulk DNA. Then we applied multiplexed-scAEBS to 159 single CTCs from 11 patients with metastatic breast and six with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, isolated via CellSearch (EpCAM(pos)/CK(pos)/CD45(neg)/DAPI(pos)) and subsequent FACS sorting. In contrast to CD45(pos) white blood cells isolated and processed by the identical approach, we observed in the isolated CTCs methylation patterns resembling more those of epithelial-like cells. Methylation at the promoter of microRNA-200 family was significantly higher in prostate CTCs. Data from our single-cell analysis revealed an epigenetic heterogeneity among CTCs and indicates tumor-specific active epigenetic regulation of EMT-associated genes during blood-borne dissemination.Oncogene advance online publication, 9 January 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.480.

28068320	Myc suppresses tumor invasion and cell migration by inhibiting JNK signaling.	Tumor metastasis, but not primary overgrowth, is the leading cause of mortality for cancer patients. During the past decade, Drosophila melanogaster has been well-accepted as an excellent model to address the intrinsic mechanism of different aspects of cancer progression, ranging from tumor initiation to metastasis. In a genetic screen performed in Drosophila, aiming to find novel modulators of tumor invasion, we identified the oncoprotein Myc as a negative regulator. While expression of Myc dramatically blocks tumor invasion and cell migration, loss of Myc promotes cell migration in vivo. The activity of Myc is further enhanced by the co-expression of its transcription partner Max. Mechanistically, we found Myc/Max directly upregulates the transcription of puc, which encodes an inhibitor of JNK signaling crucial for tumor invasion and cell migration. Furthermore, we demonstrated that human cMyc potently suppresses JNK-dependent cell invasion and migration in both Drosophila and lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. These findings provide novel molecular insights into Myc-mediated cancer progression and raise the noteworthy problem in therapeutic strategies as inhibiting Myc might conversely accelerate tumor metastasis.Oncogene advance online publication, 9 January 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.463.

28068319	FBXO32 suppresses breast cancer tumorigenesis through targeting KLF4 to proteasomal degradation.	Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4, GKLF) is a zinc-finger transcription factor involved in a large variety of cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle progression, as well as stem cell renewal. KLF4 is critical for cell fate decision and has an ambivalent role in tumorigenesis. Emerging data keep reminding us that KLF4 dysregulation either facilitates or impedes tumor progression, making it important to clarify the regulating network of KLF4. Like most transcription factors, KLF4 has a rather short half-life within the cell and its turnover must be carefully orchestrated by ubiquitination and ubiquitin-proteasome system. To better understand the mechanism of KLF4 ubiquitination, we performed a genome-wide screen of E3 ligase small interfering RNA library based on western blot and identified SCF-FBXO32 to be a new E3 ligase, which is responsible for KLF4 ubiquitination and degradation. The F-box domain is critical for FBXO32-dependent KLF4 ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that FBXO32 physically interacts with the N-terminus (1-60 aa) of KLF4 via its C-terminus (228-355 aa) and directly targets KLF4 for ubiquitination and degradation. We also found out that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway may be implicated in FBXO32-mediated ubiquitination of KLF4, as p38 kinase inhibitor coincidently abrogates endogenous KLF4 ubiquitination and degradation, as well as FBXO32-dependent exogenous KLF4 ubiquitination and degradation. Finally, FBXO32 inhibits colony formation in vitro and primary tumor initiation and growth in vivo through targeting KLF4 into degradation. Our findings thus further elucidate the tumor-suppressive function of FBXO32 in breast cancer. These results expand our understanding of the posttranslational modification of KLF4 and of its role in breast cancer development and provide a potential target for diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of breast cancer.Oncogene advance online publication, 9 January 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.479.

28067913	Impaired H3K36 methylation defines a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.	Human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are deadly and common cancers. Recent genomic studies implicate multiple genetic pathways, including cell signaling, cell cycle and immune evasion, in their development. Here we analyze public data sets and uncover a previously unappreciated role of epigenome deregulation in the genesis of 13% of HPV-negative HNSCCs. Specifically, we identify novel recurrent mutations encoding p.Lys36Met (K36M) alterations in multiple H3 histone genes. histones. We further validate the presence of these alterations in multiple independent HNSCC data sets and show that, along with previously described NSD1 mutations, they correspond to a specific DNA methylation cluster. The K36M substitution and NSD1 defects converge on altering methylation of histone H3 at K36 (H3K36), subsequently blocking cellular differentiation and promoting oncogenesis. Our data further indicate limited redundancy for NSD family members in HPV-negative HNSCCs and suggest a potential role for impaired H3K36 methylation in their development. Further investigation of drugs targeting chromatin regulators is warranted in HPV-negative HNSCCs driven by aberrant H3K36 methylation.	NA	2
28067912	Genome-wide association study identifies distinct genetic contributions to prognosis and susceptibility in Crohn's disease.	For most immune-mediated diseases, the main determinant of patient well-being is not the diagnosis itself but instead the course that the disease takes over time (prognosis). Prognosis may vary substantially between patients for reasons that are poorly understood. Familial studies support a genetic contribution to prognosis, but little evidence has been found for a proposed association between prognosis and the burden of susceptibility variants. To better characterize how genetic variation influences disease prognosis, we performed a within-cases genome-wide association study in two cohorts of patients with Crohn's disease. We identified four genome-wide significant loci, none of which showed any association with disease susceptibility. Conversely, the aggregated effect of all 170 disease susceptibility loci was not associated with disease prognosis. Together, these data suggest that the genetic contribution to prognosis in Crohn's disease is largely independent of the contribution to disease susceptibility and point to a biology of prognosis that could provide new therapeutic opportunities.

28065619	Tumor-associated macrophage expression of PD-L1 in implants of high grade serous ovarian carcinoma: A comparison of matched primary and metastatic tumors.	OBJECTIVE: Data on PD-L1 expression in high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is mixed. Some studies report robust tumor staining and others identify expression limited to tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). TAM PD-L1 expression is induced in HGSOC metastatic implants from patients who have undergone chemotherapy. However, it is unclear whether TAM acquisition of PD-L1 plays a role in treatment naïve tumors. We investigated PD-L1 expression in primary ovarian tumors and matched metastatic implants from predominantly treatment-naïve HGSOC.METHODS: Sixty one primary HGSOC were evaluated with PD-L1 and CD68 IHC: 40 on TMA and 21 on whole section. Whole section cases were matched to a metastatic implant. TAM were delineated by CD68. Membranous PD-L1 staining was scored separately for tumor cells and TAM.RESULTS: Eight percent of primary HGSOC demonstrated PD-L1 expression. In contrast, 74% showed PD-L1+ TAM. In the 16 treatment naïve cases, 13 (81.3%) demonstrated fidelity in intratumoral PD-L1 expression between the primary and metastatic site. Of the 21 matched pairs, only one case (4.8%) did not exhibit PD-L1 positive TAM in the metastatic implant and 19 (90.5%) showed fidelity across both locations. Intratumoral and immune infiltrate PD-L1 expression was not different in cases who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to treatment naïve cases.CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1+ TAM are common in both primary and metastatic HGSOC however tumoral PD-L1 staining is rare. There was high fidelity of PD-L1 expression when comparing primary tumors and metastatic implants in treatment naïve specimens. Clinical trials are needed to determine whether tumor-associated staining correlates with clinical response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition.	NA	0
28065618	Pathological features and clinical behavior of Lynch syndrome-associated ovarian cancer.	OBJECTIVE: Lynch syndrome (LS) is an inherited tumor predisposition condition caused by mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Mutation carriers are at increased risk of various malignancies, including ovarian cancer (OC). Relatively little is known about the pathological features and clinical behavior of LS associated OC.METHODS: We analyzed the data of 1047 proven MMR mutated individuals from a prospectively maintained database at a large referral center for genomic medicine in the North West of England. Data were crosschecked with pathology reports, the National Cancer Registry and death certificates, where appropriate. Data from gynecological surveillance and risk reducing surgery were analyzed.RESULTS: We identified 53 cases of LSAOC in proven MMR mutated individuals. The cumulative risk of LSAOC was 20% at age 80 in those who retained their ovaries. LSAOC presented at an earlier age (average 51, range 24-70years) than sporadic OC. The predominant histological subtype was endometrioid adenocarcinoma (53%). Most cases presented early (85% at stage I/II vs. 15% at stage III/IV, p&lt;0.001) and overall survival was excellent (80% 5-year survival), however, patients with advanced disease had a poor prognosis (40% 5-year survival). Most women were found to have LS after their OC diagnosis, however, two were detected at Stage 1c through gynecological surveillance and a further three were detected following surgery for screen-detected synchronous endometrial pathology.CONCLUSION: The predominance of early stage disease in LSAOC is linked to its good prognosis. We support risk-reducing surgery for women whose families are complete especially if undertaking hysterectomy for endometrial risk, and ovarian surveillance as part of gynecological screening for those who have not.

28065413	Therapeutic Targeting of MLL Degradation Pathways in MLL-Rearranged Leukemia.	Chromosomal translocations of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene with various partner genes result in aggressive leukemia with dismal outcomes. Despite similar expression at the mRNA level from the wild-type and chimeric MLL alleles, the chimeric protein is more stable. We report that UBE2O functions in regulating the stability of wild-type MLL in response to interleukin-1 signaling. Targeting wild-type MLL degradation impedes MLL leukemia cell proliferation, and it downregulates a specific group of target genes of the MLL chimeras and their oncogenic cofactor, the super elongation complex. Pharmacologically inhibiting this pathway substantially delays progression, and it improves survival of murine leukemia through stabilizing wild-type MLL protein, which displaces the MLL chimera from some of its target genes and, therefore, relieves the cellular oncogenic addiction to MLL chimeras. Stabilization of MLL provides us with a paradigm in the development of therapies for aggressive MLL leukemia and perhaps for other cancers caused by translocations.	NA	0
28067666	Versatile humanized niche model enables study of normal and malignant human hematopoiesis.	The BM niche comprises a tightly controlled microenvironment formed by specific tissue and cells that regulates the behavior of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here, we have provided a 3D model that is tunable in different BM niche components and useful, both in vitro and in vivo, for studying the maintenance of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Using scaffolds, we tested the capacity of different stromal cell types to support human HSCs. Scaffolds coated with human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) proved to be superior in terms of HSC engraftment and long-term maintenance when implanted in vivo. Moreover, we found that hMSC-coated scaffolds can be modulated to form humanized bone tissue, which was also able to support human HSC engraftment. Importantly, hMSC-coated humanized scaffolds were able to support the growth of leukemia patient cells in vivo, including the growth of samples that would not engraft the BM of immunodeficient mice. These results demonstrate that an s.c. implantation approach in a 3D carrier scaffold seeded with stromal cells is an effective in vivo niche model for studying human hematopoiesis. The various niche components of this model can be changed depending on the context to improve the engraftment of nonengrafting acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples.	NA	0
28067665	Selective graft-versus-leukemia depends on magnitude and diversity of the alloreactive T cell response.	Patients with leukemia who receive a T cell-depleted allogeneic stem cell graft followed by postponed donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) can experience graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reactivity, with a lower risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Here, we have investigated the magnitude, diversity, and specificity of alloreactive CD8 T cells in patients who developed GVL reactivity after DLI in the absence or presence of GVHD. We observed a lower magnitude and diversity of CD8 T cells for minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHAs) in patients with selective GVL reactivity without GVHD. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MiHA-specific T cell clones from patients with selective GVL reactivity showed lower reactivity against nonhematopoietic cells, even when pretreated with inflammatory cytokines. Expression analysis of MiHA-encoding genes showed that similar types of antigens were recognized in both patient groups, but in patients who developed GVHD, T cell reactivity was skewed to target broadly expressed MiHAs. As an inflammatory environment can render nonhematopoietic cells susceptible to T cell recognition, prevention of such circumstances favors induction of selective GVL reactivity without development of GVHD.

28067955	Cancer preventive services, socioeconomic status, and the Affordable Care Act.	BACKGROUND: Out-of-pocket expenditures are thought to be an important barrier to the receipt of cancer preventive services, especially for those of a lower socioeconomic status (SES). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) eliminated out-of-pocket expenditures for recommended services, including mammography and colonoscopy. The objective of this study was to determine changes in the uptake of mammography and colonoscopy among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries before and after ACA implementation.METHODS: Using Medicare claims data, this study identified women who were 70 years old or older and had not undergone mammography in the previous 2 years and men and women who were 70 years old or older, were at increased risk for colorectal cancer, and had not undergone colonoscopy in the past 5 years. The receipt of procedures in the 2-year period before the ACA's implementation (2009-2010) and after its implementation (2011 to September 2012) was also identified. Multivariate generalized estimating equation models were used to determine the independent association and county-level quartile of median income and education with the receipt of testing.RESULTS: For mammography, a lower SES quartile was associated with less uptake, but the post-ACA disparities were smaller than those in the pre-ACA period. In addition, mammography rates increased from the pre-ACA period to the post-ACA period in all SES quartiles. For colonoscopy, in both the pre- and post-ACA periods, there was an association between uptake and educational level and, to some extent, income. However, there were no appreciable changes in colonoscopy and SES after implementation of the ACA.CONCLUSIONS: The removal of out-of-pocket expenditures may overcome a barrier to the receipt of recommended preventive services, but for colonoscopy, other procedural factors may remain as deterrents.

28067948	Preoperative assessment of lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer: A Korean Gynecologic Oncology Group study.	BACKGROUND: Previously proposed criteria for preoperatively identifying endometrial cancer patients at low risk for lymph node metastasis remain to be verified. For this purpose, a prospective, multicenter observational study was performed.METHODS: Eligible patients with histologically confirmed endometrial cancer underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and serum cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) testing before surgery. The following criteria were used to identify low-risk patients: 1) endometrioid-type cancer, 2) no evidence of deep myometrial invasion on MRI, 3) no enlarged lymph nodes on MRI, 4) no suspicious metastasis out of the uterine corpus, and 5) serum CA 125 levels less than 35 U/mL. Systematic pelvic and/or para-aortic lymphadenectomy was performed for all patients. The primary endpoint was estimation of the negative predictive value (NPV).RESULTS: From January 2012 to December 2014, 529 patients from 20 hospitals in 3 Asian countries were consecutively enrolled. According to our criteria, 272 patients (51.4%) were categorized into the low-risk group. Fifty-three of the 529 patients (10.0%) had lymph node metastases; these patients included 8 (2.9%) falsely categorized as low-risk. The sensitivity and specificity of the criteria were 84.9% and 55.5%, respectively. The NPV of 97.1% was higher than the predefined target endpoint of 96%.CONCLUSIONS: The low-risk criteria based on preoperative tests were confirmed to be reliable and accurate for identifying patients at low risk for lymph node metastasis. These criteria may facilitate patient counseling and surgical decision making. Cancer 2017;123:263-272. © 2016 American Cancer Society.	NA	0
28066861	The incidence of cardiomyopathy in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers after anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy.	PURPOSE: Breast cancer remains the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States. Nearly 10% of breast cancers are hereditary, with deleterious mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes being the leading cause. Anthracycline chemotherapy, used commonly for breast cancer, carries cardiotoxicity risk. Recent studies demonstrated anthracycline-induced cardiac failure in homozygous BRCA2-deficient mice and increased rates of heart failure in homozygous BRCA1-deficient mice following ischemic insult. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective matched cohort study to determine the rates of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy in breast cancer patients with germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes compared to age-matched patients without a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation.METHODS: The primary endpoint was to determine the rate of cardiomyopathy defined as either congestive heart failure or asymptomatic decline in ejection fraction to &lt;50%. A total of 102 breast cancer patients who were BRCA gene mutation carriers (55 BRCA1, 45 BRCA2, and two with both), who received anthracycline-based chemotherapy were compared to a matched cohort of breast cancer patients with wild-type BRCA gene status.RESULTS: We found a 4.9% rate of cardiomyopathy in the BRCA mutation carriers and 5.2% in the matched controls (p = 0.99). Cox proportional hazards model showed that only trastuzumab and hypertension were significantly associated with the development of cardiomyopathy in both groups (p &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Given the limitations of a retrospective study, we saw no increased risk of cardiotoxicity among breast cancer patients with BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 gene mutations treated with standard doses of anthracycline compared to the general population.

28067867	Germline BRCA2 mutations drive prostate cancers with distinct evolutionary trajectories.	Germline mutations in the BRCA2 tumour suppressor are associated with both an increased lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer (PCa) and increased risk of aggressive disease. To understand this aggression, here we profile the genomes and methylomes of localized PCa from 14 carriers of deleterious germline BRCA2 mutations (BRCA2-mutant PCa). We show that BRCA2-mutant PCa harbour increased genomic instability and a mutational profile that more closely resembles metastastic than localized disease. BRCA2-mutant PCa shows genomic and epigenomic dysregulation of the MED12L/MED12 axis, which is frequently dysregulated in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This dysregulation is enriched in BRCA2-mutant PCa harbouring intraductal carcinoma (IDC). Microdissection and sequencing of IDC and juxtaposed adjacent non-IDC invasive carcinoma in 10 patients demonstrates a common ancestor to both histopathologies. Overall we show that localized castration-sensitive BRCA2-mutant tumours are uniquely aggressive, due to de novo aberration in genes usually associated with metastatic disease, justifying aggressive initial treatment.	prognostic	1
28067246	Mutant U2AF1-expressing cells are sensitive to pharmacological modulation of the spliceosome.	Somatic mutations in spliceosome genes are detectable in ∼50% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We hypothesize that cells harbouring spliceosome gene mutations have increased sensitivity to pharmacological perturbation of the spliceosome. We focus on mutant U2AF1 and utilize sudemycin compounds that modulate pre-mRNA splicing. We find that haematopoietic cells expressing mutant U2AF1(S34F), including primary patient cells, have an increased sensitivity to in vitro sudemycin treatment relative to controls. In vivo sudemycin treatment of U2AF1(S34F) transgenic mice alters splicing and reverts haematopoietic progenitor cell expansion induced by mutant U2AF1 expression. The splicing effects of sudemycin and U2AF1(S34F) can be cumulative in cells exposed to both perturbations-drug and mutation-compared with cells exposed to either alone. These cumulative effects may result in downstream phenotypic consequences in sudemycin-treated mutant cells. Taken together, these data suggest a potential for treating haematological cancers harbouring U2AF1 mutations with pre-mRNA splicing modulators like sudemycins.	NA	0
28067227	CDK4/6-dependent activation of DUB3 regulates cancer metastasis through SNAIL1.	Tumour metastasis, the spread of cancer cells from the original tumour site followed by growth of secondary tumours at distant organs, is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths and remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of CDK4/6 blocks breast tumour metastasis in the triple-negative breast cancer model, without affecting tumour growth. Mechanistically, we identify a deubiquitinase, DUB3, as a target of CDK4/6; CDK4/6-mediated activation of DUB3 is essential to deubiquitinate and stabilize SNAIL1, a key factor promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and breast cancer metastasis. Overall, our study establishes the CDK4/6-DUB3 axis as an important regulatory mechanism of breast cancer metastasis and provides a rationale for potential therapeutic interventions in the treatment of breast cancer metastasis.

28067673	A novel STAT3 inhibitor HO-3867 induces cell apoptosis by reactive oxygen species-dependent endoplasmic reticulum stress in human pancreatic cancer cells.	Pancreatic cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among solid tumors and has shown an increasing trend year by year. Thus, there is an urgent need for the discovery of new anticancer drugs for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In recent years, it has been reported that the compound HO-3867, a novel analog of the natural product curcumin, showed antitumor activity with low toxicity. However, the underlying mechanism of this compound's attack on cancer cells is not very clear. In the present study, it was found that HO-3867 showed good antitumor activity at the concentration of 2 μmol/l in PANC-1 and BXPC-3 cells. Importantly, it was also found that HO-3867 treatment significantly induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in human pancreatic cancer cell lines, inducing PANC-1 and BXPC-3 cells. Co-treatment with the ROS scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine, partially abrogated HO-3867-induced cell apoptosis. The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and endoplasmic reticulum stress indicated a downstream event of ROS generation in mediating the anticancer effect of the HO-3876. In addition, independent of the ROS pathway, direct STAT3 inhibition was observed in HO-3867-induced cell apoptosis. Taken together, the results of this work suggest that both the ROS-dependent ER stress and STAT3 pathways were implicated in the cell apoptosis induced by the novel compound HO-3867.	NA	0
28065620	Treatment Response and Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation Are Prognostic Factors in a Real-life Limited-disease Small-cell Lung Cancer Patient Cohort Comprehensively Staged With Cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging.	INTRODUCTION: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has proven to decrease the incidence of brain metastases (BMs), with a modest improvement in survival.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The impact of PCI was evaluated in 184 patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. PCI was applied to patients with disease with partial and complete response only when cranial magnetic resonance imaging before and after primary treatment revealed no BMs. Correlation between PCI and overall survival (OS), BM-free survival (BMFS), and time to progression (TTP) was analyzed to describe survival within subgroups.RESULTS: Concurrent and sequential chemoradiotherapy was applied in 71 patients (39%) and 113 patients (61%), respectively. Seventy-one patients (39%) with partial and complete response were treated with PCI. Metachronous BMs were detected in 16 (23%) of 71 patients in the PCI group compared to 42 (37%) of 113 patients in the non-PCI group. Median BMFS in the PCI group was not reached; it was 23.6 months in the non-PCI group. Median OS and TTP were 26 months (range, 19.4-32.6 months) in the PCI group versus 14 months (range, 11.4-16.6 months) in patients without PCI whose disease responded to therapy versus 9 months in patients with disease that did not respond to therapy (P &lt; .0001), and 27 versus 14.5 months (range, 9.0-19.9 months) versus 8.8 months (range, 7.7-9.9 months) (P &lt; .0001) in the PCI group versus those with response without PCI versus those with nonresponse. The effect of PCI was independent of gender. On multivariate analysis, PCI was a variable correlating with OS (hazard ratio = 1.899; 95% confidence interval, 1.370-2.632; P &lt; .0001) and TTP (hazard ratio = 2.164; 95% confidence interval, 1.371-3.415; P = .001) after adjustment for other prognostic factors.CONCLUSION: In real-life patients comprehensively staged with cranial magnetic resonance imaging, treatment response and PCI strongly correlated with prolonged OS, TTP, and BMFS.

28065467	Lung Adenocarcinoma With MUC4 Expression Is Associated With Smoking Status, HER2 Protein Expression, and Poor Prognosis: Clinicopathologic Analysis of 338 Cases.	BACKGROUND: MUC4 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a role in the cell growth signaling pathway and has been studied in various organ malignancies. This study aimed to analyze MUC4 expression in resected lung adenocarcinomas (ADCs) to define the clinicopathologic characteristics of MUC4-positive cancers.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical MUC4 analysis was performed using tissue microarray slides containing 338 lung ADCs. Associations between MUC4 expression and the following clinicopathologic parameters were evaluated: sex; age; smoking status; tumor stage; tumor grade; lymphovascular invasion; pleural invasion; TTF-1 and HNF4α expression; EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, and HER2 mutation status; and ALK and ROS1 fusion status.RESULTS: Ninety-four tumors (27.8%) were MUC4 positive. Most patients with MUC4-positive tumors were male (P &lt; .001) and smokers (P = .006). Moreover, MUC4 expression was significantly associated with solid ADCs (P &lt; .001) and vascular invasion (P = .001). MUC4 expression inversely correlated with TTF-1 expression (P = .020) and EGFR mutations (P = .004). Interestingly, MUC4 expression correlated with HER2 protein expression (P = .042), although MUC4 expression did not correlate with HER2 DNA amplification or HER2 gene mutations. Patients with MUC4-positive tumors had significantly worse prognoses compared to patients with MUC4-negative tumors (P = .025).CONCLUSION: The present study showed that MUC4-positive lung ADCs correlated with male smokers, solid ADCs, negative TTF-1 expression, the EGFR wild-type gene, HER2 protein expression, and poorer prognoses. These results suggest that MUC4-positive lung ADC may be a distinct subtype found in patients with smoking-related poor outcomes, mediated by HER2 signaling pathway.	NA	2
28065466	Sequential Use of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Inhibitors in Japanese Patients With ALK-Rearranged Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Retrospective Analysis.	BACKGROUND: Second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors, such as alectinib and ceritinib, have recently been approved for treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). An optimal strategy for using 2 or more ALK inhibitors has not been established. We sought to investigate the clinical impact of sequential use of ALK inhibitors on these tumors in clinical practice.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated from May 2010 to January 2016 at the National Cancer Center Hospital were identified, and their outcomes were evaluated retrospectively.RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC had been treated and 37 cases were assessable. Twenty-six received crizotinib, 21 received alectinib, and 13 (35.1%) received crizotinib followed by alectinib. Response rates and median progression-free survival (PFS) on crizotinib and alectinib (after crizotinib failure) were 53.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26.7%-80.9%) and 38.4% (95% CI, 12.0%-64.9%), and 10.7 (95% CI, 5.3-14.7) months and 16.6 (95% CI, 2.9-not calculable), respectively. The median PFS of patients on sequential therapy was 35.2 months (95% CI, 12.7 months-not calculable). The 5-year survival rate of ALK-rearranged patients who received 2 sequential ALK inhibitors from diagnosis was 77.8% (95% CI, 36.5%-94.0%).CONCLUSION: The combined PFS and 5-year survival rates in patients who received sequential ALK inhibitors were encouraging. Making full use of multiple ALK inhibitors might be important to prolonging survival in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC.	NA	1
28065465	A Multicenter Double-blind Phase II Study of Metformin With Gefitinib as First-line Therapy of Locally Advanced Non-Small-cell Lung Cancer.	We present the rationale and study design of the CGMT (combined gefitinib and metformin therapy) trial (www.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01864681), which is aimed at treating locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. The CGMT trial is a multicenter, phase II randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled study, which is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of metformin in combination with gefitinib as first-line therapy in patients presenting with stage IIIb-IV non-small-cell lung cancer expressing the epidermal growth factor receptor mutant. Two therapies are proposed for this trial. The first regimen is comprised of gefitinib plus metformin. The second therapy is comprised of gefitinib plus placebo. The primary objective of this trail is to compare the progression-free survival rate at year 1 of the study. The secondary objective of this trial is to compare the 2-year overall survival, the 2-year progression-free survival, the objective response rate, and the disease-control rate, and to evaluate the relative safety of both therapies. Based on the statistical design, we plan to enroll approximately 200 patients.	NA	2
28065789	Choline Kinase Alpha Mediates Interactions Between the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor and mTORC2 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells to Promote Drug Resistance and Xenograft Tumor Progression.	BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Choline kinase alpha (CHKA) catalyzes conversion of choline to phosphocholine and can contribute to carcinogenesis. Little is known about the role of CHKA in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).METHODS: We performed whole-exome and transcriptome sequence analyses of 9 paired HCC and non-tumor adjacent tissues. We performed tissue chip analyses of 120 primary HCC and non-tumor adjacent tissues from patients who received surgery in Shanghai, China from January 2006 through December 2009; 48 sets of specimens (HCC and non-tumor adjacent tissues) were also analyzed. CHKA gene copy number was quantified and findings were validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis. CHKA messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were determined by PCR, immunohistochemical, and immunoblot analyses. CHKA was examined in 2 hepatocyte cell lines and 7 HCC-derived cell lines, and knocked down with small interfering RNAs in 3 HCC cell lines. Cells were analyzed in proliferation, wound-healing, migration, and invasion assays. Cells were injected into tail veins of mice and tumor growth and metastasis were quantified. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays were conducted to determine interactions between CHKA and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).RESULTS: Levels of CHKA mRNA were frequently increased in HCC tissues, compared with non-tumor tissues; increased expression associated with amplification at the CHKA loci. Tumors that expressed high levels of CHKA had more aggressive phenotypes, and patients with these tumors had shorter survival times after surgery, compared to patients whose tumors expressed low levels of CHKA. HCC cell lines that stably overexpressed CHKA had higher levels of migration and invasion than control HCC cells, and formed larger xenograft tumors with more metastases in mice, compared to HCC cells that did not overexpress CHKA. CHKA was required for physical interaction between EGFR and mTORC2. This complex was required for HCC cells to form metastatic xenograft tumors in mice and to become resistant to EGFR inhibitors.CONCLUSIONS: We found levels of CHKA to be increased in human HCCs, compared to non-tumor tissues, and increased expression to be associated with tumor aggressiveness and reduced survival times of patients. Overexpression of CHKA in HCC cell lines increased their invasiveness, resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and ability to form metastatic tumors in mice by promoting interaction of EGFR with mTORC2.	therapeutic	1

28067327	Intratumoral and peritumoral lymphatic vessel density both correlate with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer.	The status of lymph node involvement is an important prognostic factor for breast cancer. However, the presence of intratumoral lymphatic vessels in primary tumor lesions and the relationship between lymphatic vessel density (LVD) and lymph node metastasis (LNM) have not been firmly established. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis study to investigate these issues. According to the pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria, 13 studies, involving 1029 breast cancer patients, were included in this study. Using immunohistochemical staining, intratumoral lymphatic vessels were detected in 40.07% of breast cancer patients (240/599), and peritumoral lymphatics were detected in 77.09% (397/515). All studies demonstrated that peritumoral LVD was higher than intratumoral LVD, with a pooled standard mean difference and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 1.75 (1.28 to 2.21). Both intratumoral LVD and peritumoral LVD positively correlated with LNM, with correlation coefficients of 0.14 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.23) and 0.31 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.49), respectively. In summary, our study reports the overall detection rate of intratumoral lymphatics and demonstrates the associations between intratumoral LVD, peritumoral LVD, and LNM in breast cancer. Additionally, controlled studies with a larger number of subjects are needed to establish these relationships.	NA	0
28067282	Gastroprotective [6]-Gingerol Aspirinate as a Novel Chemopreventive Prodrug of Aspirin for Colon Cancer.	A growing body of research suggests daily low-dose aspirin (ASA) reduces heart diseases and colorectal cancers. However, the major limitation to the use of aspirin is its side effect to cause ulceration and bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. Preclinical studies have shown that ginger constituents ameliorate ASA-induced gastric ulceration. We here report the design and synthesis of a novel prodrug of aspirin, [6]-gingerol aspirinate (GAS). Our data show that GAS exerts enhanced anti-cancer properties in vitro and superior gastroprotective effects in mice. GAS was also able to survive stomach acid and decomposed in intestinal linings or after absorption to simultaneously release ASA and [6]-gingerol. We further present that GAS inactivates both COX-1 and COX-2 equally. Our results demonstrate the enhanced anticancer properties along with gastroprotective effects of GAS, suggesting that GAS can be a therapeutic equivalent for ASA in inflammatory and proliferative diseases without the deleterious effects on stomach mucosa.

28067243	Association of Polymorphisms in three pri-miRNAs that Target Pepsinogen C with the Risk and Prognosis of Gastric Cancer.	We aimed to explore the associations of polymorphisms in three microRNAs (miRNAs) (let-7e rs8111742, miR-365b rs121224 and miR-4795 rs1002765) that target PGC with the risk and prognosis of gastric cancer/atrophic gastritis. Sequenom's MassArray was used to genotype the miRNA polymorphisms in 724 gastric cancer cases, 862 atrophic gastritis cases and 862 controls in a Chinese population. We found that let-7e rs8111742 and miR-4795 rs1002765 were associated with the risk of gastric cancer in the H. pylori-positive subgroup. MiR-365b rs121224 was associated with the risk of intestinal-type gastric cancer in the alcohol consumption subgroup. Intestinal-type gastric cancer patients at Borrmann stages III-IV who carry the miR-365b rs121224 GG genotype had better prognosis compared with those who carry the CG or CC genotypes. MiR-365b rs121224 was associated with Lauren typing and TNM staging, in which the distribution of GG genotype carriers in intestinal-type gastric cancer and the TNM stage I-II subgroup was higher than that of CG or CC genotypes, which contrasted with the distribution in diffuse-type gastric cancer or TNM III-IV groups. These findings suggested that the polymorphisms in these miRNAs might be biomarkers for gastric cancer risk and prognosis, especially for populations infected with Helicobacter pylori or who consume alcohol.

28066929	Diagnostic Work-up of Acute Myeloid Leukemia.	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by a clonal expansion of undifferentiated myeloid precursors resulting in impaired hematopoiesis and bone marrow failure. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) published revisions to the classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias. Similar to the 2008 classification, the updated classification incorporates clinical features, morphology, immunophenotyping, and cytogenetics, with greater emphasis on molecular genetics, to define disease entities.

28065856	Hypoxia promotes mitochondrial glutamine metabolism through HIF1α-GDH pathway in human lung cancer cells.	Drug-resistance is common in human lung cancer therapy. Hypoxia remarkably contributes to drug-resistance in lung cancer but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that hypoxia-induced glutamine metabolism is involved in drug resistance in lung cancer cells. Hypoxia increases glutamine up-take, glutamate to α-ketoglutarate flux and the generation of ATP in lung cancer cells by up-regulating the expression of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Hypoxia-induced expression of GDH relies on the up-regulation of HIF1α but not HIF2α. HIF1α binds the promoter of GDH and promotes the transcription of GDH gene in lung cancer cells. Finally, we show that GDH represses cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis and repression of colony formation, indicating that GDH contributes to drug-resistance in lung cancer cells. In conclusion, HIF1α-GDH pathway regulates glutamine metabolism and ATP production upon hypoxia stress and contributes to drug-resistance in human lung cancer cells.	NA	0
28065399	Oncologic Safety of Immediate Breast Reconstruction in Breast Cancer Patients Who Underwent Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: Short-Term Outcomes of a Matched Case-Control Study.	INTRODUCTION: Although the indication for immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) after skin-sparing mastectomy (SSM) or nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) has been expanded, IBR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is still controversial. We conducted retrospective matched case-control study to analyze oncologic outcomes between patients who underwent TM only and those who underwent IBR after SSM or NSM after NACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of breast cancer patients who underwent IBR after SSM or NSM after NACT between 2008 and 2015 at a single center was conducted. These cases were maximally matched by 1:5 to patients who underwent total mastectomy (TM) alone after NACT. Matching variables included age, clinical T and N stage before NACT, response to NACT, and pathologic stage after NACT. Pathologic stage followed the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification.RESULTS: Overall, 31 patients were enrolled onto the IBR after SSM or NSM group (study group) and matched to 85 patients (control group). In the study group, 13 patients (41.9%) underwent NSM and 18 (58.1%) underwent SSM. Median follow-up duration was 29.2 (range, 7-31) and 38.8 (range, 11-85) months for the study and control groups (P = .012), respectively, and median age was 37.0 (range, 26-57) and 40.0 (range, 24-56) years (P = .890), respectively. Overall survival (P = .971), disease-free survival (P = .520), distant metastasis-free survival (P = .795), and local recurrence-free survival (P = .628) did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.CONCLUSION: IBR after SSM or NSM might be a feasible surgical treatment option even in breast cancer patients who underwent NACT.

28065398	Molecular Subtypes and Prognosis in Young Mexican Women With Breast Cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Young age represents an adverse prognostic factor in breast cancer (BC), and young women present with more advanced and aggressive disease. In Latin America, BC is increasing in young women, and there is a lack of information regarding the characteristics and outcomes of this patient population.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a database of 4315 women treated for BC at a single institution. We compared clinical characteristics, treatment, and survival between women ≤ 40 and &gt; 40 years of age. Survival analyses were performed for each molecular subtype.RESULTS: A total of 662 women (15.3%) were ≤ 40 years old. Younger women had more advanced disease, higher grade, and a larger proportion of luminal B and triple-negative tumors (P &lt; .001). At 5 years, both disease-free and overall survival (OS) were lower in younger women, although there were no differences after adjusting for stage. Five-year OS was worse for young women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative subtype (82% vs. 87.1%; P = .03), but not for those with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive or triple-negative disease. This difference can be attributed to luminal B tumors, which showed a worse 5-year OS in younger women (79.1% vs. 85.2%; P = .03).CONCLUSION: Although young Mexican patients with BC have more aggressive disease at presentation than older women, only those with luminal B tumors have a worse survival after adjusting for stage. Strategies aimed at downstaging the disease and at improving the treatment of luminal B tumors in this population are needed.	NA	0
28067907	Grhl2 reduces invasion and migration through inhibition of TGFβ-induced EMT in gastric cancer.	Metastasis is one of the typical features of malignancy that significantly increases cancer-related mortality. Recent studies have shown that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is closely related to the invasion and migration of cancer cells. Grainyhead-like 2 (Grhl2), a transcription factor, has been reported to be associated with several tumor processes including EMT. In the previous study, we have reported that Grhl2 functioned as a tumor suppressor in proliferation and apoptosis of gastric cancer. Here we aim to explore the effects of Grhl2 on invasion and migration of gastric cancer and further clarify its possible underlying mechanisms. As a result, in both SGC7901 and MKN45 cells, Grhl2 overexpression significantly inhibited the ability of invasion and migration. In addition, preliminary experiments showed that Grhl2 reduces the protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2, -7 and -9 (MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9). Most importantly, Grhl2 antagonizes transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-induced EMT, and inhibition of TGFβ signaling pathways can restore Grhl2 expression. Finally, the results of subcutaneous xenograft model indicated that Grhl2 suppresses the growth of gastric cancer and reverses EMT process in vivo. Meanwhile, the metastatic tumor model further confirmed the inhibition of Grhl2 on metastasis of gastric cancer. Taken together, our findings proved that Grhl2, functioned as a tumor suppressor, reduces the invasion and migration through inhibition of TGFβ-induced EMT in gastric cancer.	NA	0
28065864	Value of pH regulators in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer.	Altered metabolism, associated with acidification of the extracellular milieu, is one of the major features of cancer. As pH regulation is crucial for the maintenance of all biological functions, cancer cells rely on the activity of lactate exporters and proton transporters to regulate their intracellular pH. The major players in cancer pH regulation are proton pump ATPases, sodium-proton exchangers (NHEs), monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), carbonic anhydrases (CAs) and anion exchangers (AEs), which have been shown to be upregulated in several human malignancies. Thanks to the activity of the proton pumps and transporters, tumours acidify their microenvironment, becoming more aggressive and resistant to therapy. Thus, targeting tumour pH may contribute to more effective anticancer strategies for controlling tumour progression and therapeutic resistance. In the present study, we review the role of the main pH regulators expressed in human cancer cells, including their diagnostic and prognostic value, as well as their usefulness as therapeutic targets.

28066720	VDAC3 As a Potential Marker of Mitochondrial Status Is Involved in Cancer and Pathology.	VDAC3 is the least known isoform of the mammalian voltage-dependent anion selective channels of the outer mitochondrial membrane. It has been recently shown that cysteine residues of VDAC3 are found over-oxidized. The VDAC3 cysteine over-oxidation was associated with the oxidizing environment and the abundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the intermembrane space. In this work, we have examined the role of VDAC3 in general pathogenic mechanisms at the basis of mitochondrial dysfunction and involving the mitochondrial quality control. Many of the diseases reported here, including cancer and viral infections, are often associated with significant changes in the intracellular redox state. In this sense, VDAC3 bearing oxidative modifications could become marker of the oxidative load in the mitochondria and part of the ROS signaling pathway.	NA	0
28066718	The Tumor Microenvironment Modulates Choline and Lipid Metabolism.	An increase of cellular phosphocholine (PC) and total choline (tCho)-containing compounds as well as alterations in lipids have been consistently observed in cancer cells and tissue. These metabolic changes are closely related to malignant transformation, invasion, and metastasis. The study of cancer cells in culture plays an important role in understanding mechanisms leading to altered choline (Cho) and lipid metabolism in cancer, as it provides a carefully controlled environment. However, a solid tumor is a complex system with a unique tumor microenvironment frequently containing hypoxic and acidic regions and areas of nutrient deprivation and necrosis. Cancer cell-stromal cell interactions and the extracellular matrix may also alter Cho and lipid metabolism. Human tumor xenograft models in mice are useful to mimic the growth of human cancers and provide insights into the influence of in vivo conditions on metabolism. Here, we have compared metabolites, obtained with high resolution (1)H MRS of extracts from human breast and prostate cancer cells in a 2-dimensional (2D) monolayer culture and from solid tumor xenografts derived from these cells, as well as the protein expression of enzymes that regulate Cho and lipid metabolism. Our data demonstrate significant differences in Cho and lipid metabolism and protein expression patterns between human breast and prostate cancer cells in culture and in tumors derived from these cells. These data highlight the influence of the tumor microenvironment on Cho and lipid metabolism.	NA	0
28066717	Resection of Motor Eloquent Metastases Aided by Preoperative nTMS-Based Motor Maps-Comparison of Two Observational Cohorts.	INTRODUCTION: Preoperative mapping of motor areas with navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) has been shown to improve surgical outcomes for peri-Rolandic lesions and, in particular, for gliomas. However, the impact of this technique on surgical outcomes for peri-Rolandic metastatic lesions is yet unknown.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of nTMS on surgical outcomes for peri-Rolandic metastatic lesions, various clinical parameters were analyzed in our international study group.METHODS: Two prospectively enrolled cohorts were compared by investigating patients receiving preoperative nTMS (2010-2015; 120 patients) and patients who did not receive preoperative nTMS (2006-2015; 130 patients). Tumor location, pathology, size, and preoperative deficits were comparable.RESULTS: The nTMS group showed a lower rate of residual tumor on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (odds ratio 0.3025; 95% confidence interval 0.1356-0.6749). On long-term follow-up, surgery-related paresis was decreased in the nTMS group (nTMS vs. non-nTMS; improved: 30.8 vs. 13.1%, unchanged: 65.8 vs. 73.8%, worse: 3.4 vs. 13.1% of patients; p = 0.0002). Moreover, the nTMS group received smaller craniotomies (nTMS: 16.7 ± 8.6 cm(2) vs. non-nTMS: 25.0 ± 17.1 cm(2); p &lt; 0.0001). Surgical time differed significantly between the two groups (nTMS: 128.8 ± 49.4 min vs. non-nTMS: 158.0 ± 65.8 min; p = 0.0002).CONCLUSION: This non-randomized study suggests that preoperative motor mapping by nTMS may improve the treatment of patients undergoing surgical resection of metastases in peri-Rolandic regions. These findings suggest that further evaluation with a prospective, randomized trial may be warranted.	NA	0
28066716	Phase 3 Randomized Low-Dose Paclitaxel Chemoradiotherapy Study for Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) but is associated with poor chest tumor control. Here, we report results of a randomized phase 3 study comparing two CCRT regimens in improving chest tumor control by low-dose paclitaxel chemoradiation for LA-NSCLC.METHODS: Due to the logistics of local referral pattern, the study was designed to enroll patients with stage III LA-NSCLC who had completed 2-4 cycles of full-dose chemotherapy. One hundred thirty four were randomized to either Arm 1 [paclitaxel at 15 mg/m(2), three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for 6 weeks, n = 74] or Arm 2 (weekly paclitaxel at 45 mg/m(2) for 6 weeks, n = 60). Chest radiotherapy was 60-70 Gy in standard fractionation. Response rate was the primary endpoint, with recurrence-free survival (RFS) as the secondary endpoint.RESULTS: From March 2006 to February 2013, 71 patients completed Arm 1 treatment and 59 completed Arm 2 treatment. The response rate for Arm 1 was significantly higher (83.1%) than Arm 2 (54.2%) (p=0.001). RFS was superior in Arm 1: median 14.6 vs. 9.4 months, p = 0.005, Hazard ratio (HR) 1.87 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20, 2.90]. Overall survival was not significantly different: median 32.6 months in Arm 1 vs. 31.3 months in Arm 2, p = 0.91, HR 0.97 (95% CI 0.55, 1.70). Toxicity was significantly lower in Arm 1 for Grade 3 and 4 leukopenia/neutropenia (p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSION: Pulsed low-dose paclitaxel CCRT resulted in significantly better RFS and tumor response rate, and less hematologic toxicities than weekly CCRT for LA-NSCLC.

28066715	Challenges in Drug Discovery for Neurofibromatosis Type 1-Associated Low-Grade Glioma.	Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder that results from germline mutations of the NF1 gene, creating a predisposition to low-grade gliomas (LGGs; pilocytic astrocytoma) in young children. Insufficient data and resources represent major challenges to identifying the best possible drug therapies for children with this tumor. Herein, we summarize the currently available cell lines, genetically engineered mouse models, and therapeutic targets for these LGGs. Conspicuously absent are human tumor-derived cell lines or patient-derived xenograft models for NF1-LGG. New collaborative initiatives between patients and their families, research groups, and pharmaceutical companies are needed to create transformative resources and broaden the knowledge base relevant to identifying cooperating genetic drivers and possible drug therapeutics for this common pediatric brain tumor.

28067073	Translating genomic profiling to gastrointestinal cancer treatment.	Next-generation sequencing enables faster, cheaper and more accurate whole-genome sequencing, allowing genome profiling and discovery of molecular features. As molecular targeted drugs are developed, treatment can be tailored according to molecular subtype. Gastric and colorectal cancers have each been divided into four subtypes according to molecular features. Profiling of the esophageal cancer genome is underway and its classification is anticipated. To date, identification of HER2 expression in gastric adenocarcinoma and KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutations in colon cancer have proved essential for treatment decisions. However, to overcome therapy resistance and improve prognosis, further individualized therapy is required. Here, we summarize the treatment options for gastrointestinal cancer according to genomic profiling and discuss future directions.	NA	1
28069724	Synthetic lethality exploitation by an anti-Trop-2-SN-38 antibody-drug conjugate, IMMU-132, plus PARP-inhibitors in BRCA1/2-wild-type triple-negative breast cancer.	PURPOSE: Both Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) and sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) are currently under clinical evaluation in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We sought to investigate the combined DNA-damaging effects of the topoisomerase I (Topo I)-inhibitory activity of IMMU-132 with PARPi disruption of DNA repair in TNBC.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In vitro, human TNBC cell lines were incubated with IMMU-132 and various PARPi (olaparib, rucaparib, or talazoparib) to determine the effect on growth, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks, and cell-cycle arrest. Mice bearing BRCA1/2-mutated or -wild-type human TNBC tumor xenografts were treated with the combination of IMMU-132 and PARPi (olaparib or talazoparib). Study survival endpoint was tumor progression to &gt;1.0 cm3 and tolerability assessed by hematological changes.RESULTS: Combining IMMU-132 in TNBC with all three different PARPi results in synergistic growth inhibition, increased dsDNA breaks, and accumulation of cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle, regardless of BRCA1/2 status. A combination of IMMU-132 plus olaparib or talazoparib produces significantly improved antitumor effects and delay in time-to-tumor-progression compared to monotherapy in mice bearing BRCA1/2-mutated HCC1806 TNBC tumors. Furthermore, in mice bearing BRCA1/2-wild-type tumors (MDA-MB-468 or MDA-MB-231), the combination of IMMU-132 plus olaparib imparts a significant antitumor effect and survival benefit above that achieved with monotherapy. Most importantly, this combination was well tolerated, with no substantial changes in hematologic parameters.CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the added benefit of combining Topo I-inhibition mediated by IMMU-132 with synthetic lethality provided by PARPi in TNBC, regardless of BRCA1/2-status, thus supporting the rationale for such a combination clinically.

28069723	A novel murine GITR ligand fusion protein induces antitumor activity as a monotherapy, which is further enhanced in combination with an OX40 agonist.	PURPOSE: To generate and characterize a murine GITR ligand fusion protein (mGITRL-FP) designed to maximize valency and the potential to agonize the GITR receptor for cancer immunotherapy.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The EC50 value of the mGITRL-FP was compared to an anti-GITR antibody in an in vitro agonistic cell based reporter assay. We assessed the impact of dose, schedule and Fc isotype on antitumor activity and T-cell modulation in the CT26 tumor model. The activity of the mGITRL-FP was compared to an agonistic murine OX40L-FP targeting OX40, in CT26 and B16F10-Luc2 tumor models. Combination of the mGITRL-FP with antibodies targeting PD-L1, PD-1 or CTLA-4 was analysed in mice bearing CT26 tumors.RESULTS: The mGITRL-FP had an almost 50 fold higher EC50 value compared to an anti-murine GITR antibody. Treatment of CT26 tumor bearing mice with mGITRL-FP mediated significant antitumor activity that was dependent on isotype, dose and duration of exposure. The antitumor activity could be correlated with the increased proliferation of peripheral CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells and a significant decrease in the frequency of intratumoral T-regs. The combination of mGITRL-FP with mOX40L-FP or checkpoint inhibitor antagonists enhanced antitumor immunity above that of monotherapy treatment.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggests that therapeutically targeting GITR represents a unique approach to cancer immunotherapy and suggests that a multimeric fusion protein may provide increased agonistic potential versus an antibody. In addition these data provide, for the first time, early proof of concept for the potential combination of GITR targeting agents with OX40 agonists and PD-L1 antagonists.	NA	0
28069602	Oncogenic ZEB2 activation drives sensitivity towards KDM1A inhibition in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Elevated expression of the Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox transcription factor-2 (ZEB2) is correlated with poor prognosis and patient outcome in a variety of human cancer subtypes. Using a conditional gain-of-function mouse model, we recently demonstrated that ZEB2 is an oncogenic driver of immature T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a heterogenic subgroup of human leukemia characterized by a high incidence of remission failure or hematological relapse after conventional chemotherapy. Here, we identified the Lysine-specific demethylase KDM1A as a novel interaction partner of ZEB2 and demonstrated that mouse and human T-ALLs with increased ZEB2 levels critically depend on KDM1A activity for survival. Therefore, targeting the ZEB2 protein complex through direct disruption of the ZEB2-KDM1A interaction or pharmacological inhibition of the KDM1A demethylase activity itself, could serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for this aggressive subtype of human leukemia, and possibly other ZEB2-driven malignancies.

28069571	APC/C Dysfunction Limits Excessive Cancer Chromosomal Instability.	Intercellular heterogeneity, exacerbated by chromosomal instability (CIN), fosters tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance. However, extreme CIN correlates with improved cancer outcome, suggesting that karyotypic diversity required to adapt to selection pressures might be balanced in tumors against the risk of excessive instability. Here, we used a functional genomics screen, genome editing, and pharmacologic approaches to identify CIN-survival factors in diploid cells. We find partial anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) dysfunction lengthens mitosis, suppresses pharmacologically induced chromosome segregation errors, and reduces naturally occurring lagging chromosomes in cancer cell lines or following tetraploidization. APC/C impairment caused adaptation to MPS1 inhibitors, revealing a likely resistance mechanism to therapies targeting the spindle assembly checkpoint. Finally, CRISPR-mediated introduction of cancer somatic mutations in the APC/C subunit cancer driver gene CDC27 reduces chromosome segregation errors, whereas reversal of an APC/C subunit nonsense mutation increases CIN. Subtle variations in mitotic duration, determined by APC/C activity, influence the extent of CIN, allowing cancer cells to dynamically optimize fitness during tumor evolution.SIGNIFICANCE: We report a mechanism whereby cancers balance the evolutionary advantages associated with CIN against the fitness costs caused by excessive genome instability, providing insight into the consequence of CDC27 APC/C subunit driver mutations in cancer. Lengthening of mitosis through APC/C modulation may be a common mechanism of resistance to cancer therapeutics that increase chromosome segregation errors. Cancer Discov; 7(2); 1-16. ©2017 AACR.	NA	2

28069569	The Crebbp Acetyltransferase is a Haploinsufficient Tumor Suppressor in B Cell Lymphoma.	Inactivating mutations of the CREBBP acetyltransferase are highly frequent in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL), the two most common germinal-center (GC) derived cancers. However, the role of CREBBP inactivation in lymphomagenesis remains unclear. Here we show that CREBBP regulates enhancer/super-enhancer networks with central roles in GC/post-GC cell fate decisions, including genes involved in signal transduction by the B-cell receptor and CD40 receptor, transcriptional control of GC and plasma cell development, and antigen presentation. Consistently, Crebbp-deficient B-cells exhibit enhanced response to mitogenic stimuli and perturbed plasma cell differentiation. While GC-specific loss of Crebbp was insufficient to initiate malignant transformation, compound Crebbp-haploinsufficient/BCL2-transgenic mice, mimicking the genetics of FL and DLBCL, develop clonal lymphomas recapitulating the features of the human diseases. These findings establish CREBBP as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene in GC B-cells and provide insights into the mechanisms by which its loss contributes to lymphomagenesis.	NA	0
28069802	Genomic Profiling of a Large Set of Diverse Pediatric Cancers Identifies Known and Novel Mutations across Tumor Spectra.	Pediatric cancers are generally characterized by low mutational burden and few recurrently mutated genes. Recent studies suggest that genomic alterations may help guide treatment decisions and clinical trial selection. Here, we describe genomic profiles from 1,215 pediatric tumors representing sarcomas, extracranial embryonal tumors, brain tumors, hematologic malignancies, carcinomas, and gonadal tumors. Comparable published datasets identified similar frequencies of clinically relevant alterations, validating this dataset as biologically relevant. We identified novel ALK fusions in a neuroblastoma (BEND5-ALK) and an astrocytoma (PPP1CB-ALK), novel BRAF fusions in an astrocytoma (BCAS1-BRAF) and a ganglioglioma (TMEM106B-BRAF), and a novel PAX3-GLI2 fusion in a rhabdomyosarcoma. Previously characterized ALK, NTRK1, and PAX3 fusions were observed in unexpected malignancies, challenging the &quot;disease-specific&quot; alterations paradigm. Finally, we identified recurrent variants of unknown significance in MLL3 and PRSS1 predicted to have functional impact. Data from these 1,215 tumors are publicly available for discovery and validation. Cancer Res; 77(2); 1-11. ©2017 AACR.	NA	2
28069801	Aurora A and NF-κB Survival Pathway Drive Chemoresistance in Acute Myeloid Leukemia via the TRAF-Interacting Protein TIFA.	Aurora A-dependent NF-κB signaling portends poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers, but the functional basis underlying this association is unclear. Here, we report that Aurora A is essential for Thr9 phosphorylation of the TRAF-interacting protein TIFA, triggering activation of the NF-κB survival pathway in AML. TIFA protein was overexpressed concurrently with Aurora A and NF-κB signaling factors in patients with de novo AML relative to healthy individuals and also correlated with poor prognosis. Silencing TIFA in AML lines and primary patient cells decreased leukemic cell growth and chemoresistance via downregulation of prosurvival factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL that support NF-κB-dependent antiapoptotic events. Inhibiting TIFA perturbed leukemic cytokine secretion and reduced the IC50 of chemotherapeutic drug treatments in AML cells. Furthermore, in vivo delivery of TIFA-inhibitory fragments potentiated the clearance of myeloblasts in the bone marrow of xenograft-recipient mice via enhanced chemotoxicity. Collectively, our results showed that TIFA supports AML progression and that its targeting can enhance the efficacy of AML treatments. Cancer Res; 77(2); 1-15. ©2016 AACR.	NA	0
28069800	Label-Free Raman Spectroscopy Detects Stromal Adaptations in Premetastatic Lungs Primed by Breast Cancer.	Recent advances in animal modeling, imaging technology, and functional genomics have permitted precise molecular observations of the metastatic process. However, a comprehensive understanding of the premetastatic niche remains elusive, owing to the limited tools that can map subtle differences in molecular mediators in organ-specific microenvironments. Here, we report the ability to detect premetastatic changes in the lung microenvironment, in response to primary breast tumors, using a combination of metastatic mouse models, Raman spectroscopy, and multivariate analysis of consistent patterns in molecular expression. We used tdTomato fluorescent protein expressing MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells of high and low metastatic potential, respectively, to grow orthotopic xenografts in athymic nude mice and allow spontaneous dissemination from the primary mammary fat pad tumor. Label-free Raman spectroscopic mapping was used to record the molecular content of premetastatic lungs. These measurements show reliable distinctions in vibrational features, characteristic of the collageneous stroma and its cross-linkers as well as proteoglycans, which uniquely identify the metastatic potential of the primary tumor by recapitulating the compositional changes in the lungs. Consistent with histological assessment and gene expression analysis, our study suggests that remodeling of the extracellular matrix components may present promising markers for objective recognition of the premetastatic niche, independent of conventional clinical information.

28069799	IKBKE Is Required during KRAS-Induced Pancreatic Tumorigenesis.	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest malignancies lacking effective therapeutic strategies. Here, we show that the noncanonical IκB-related kinase, IKBKE, is a critical oncogenic effector during KRAS-induced pancreatic transformation. Loss of IKBKE inhibits the initiation and progression of pancreatic tumors in mice carrying pancreatic-specific KRAS activation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that this protumoral effect of IKBKE involves the activation of GLI1 and AKT signaling and is independent of the levels of activity of the NF-κB pathway. Further analysis reveals that IKBKE regulates GLI1 nuclear translocation and promotes the reactivation of AKT post-inhibition of mTOR in PDAC cells. Interestingly, combined inhibition of IKBKE and mTOR synergistically blocks pancreatic tumor growth. Together, our findings highlight the functional importance of IKBKE in pancreatic cancer, support the evaluation of IKBKE as a therapeutic target in PDAC, and suggest IKBKE inhibition as a strategy to improve efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in the clinic.

28069798	Integrative Comparison of mRNA Expression Patterns in Breast Cancers from Caucasian and Asian Americans with Implications for Precision Medicine.	Asian Americans (AS) have significantly lower incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer than Caucasian Americans (CA). Although this racial disparity has been documented, the underlying pathogenetic factors explaining it are obscure. We addressed this issue by an integrative genomics approach to compare mRNA expression between AS and CA cases of breast cancer. RNA-seq data from the Cancer Genome Atlas showed that mRNA expression revealed significant differences at gene and pathway levels. Increased susceptibility and severity in CA patients were likely the result of synergistic environmental and genetic risk factors, with arachidonic acid metabolism and PPAR signaling pathways implicated in linking environmental and genetic factors. An analysis that also added eQTL data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project and SNP data from the 1,000 Genomes Project identified several SNPs associated with differentially expressed genes. Overall, the associations we identified may enable a more focused study of genotypic differences that may help explain the disparity in breast cancer incidence and mortality rates in CA and AS populations and inform precision medicine.

28070019	SMAD7 polymorphisms and colorectal cancer risk: a meta-analysis of case-control studies.	Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 7 (SMAD7) inhibits the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway, which regulates carcinogenesis and cancer progression. A number of studies have reported that SMAD7 polymorphisms (rs4464148, rs4939827, and rs12953717) are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, but the results from these studies remain conflicting. To determine a more precise estimation of the relationship between SMAD7 and CRC, we undertook a large-scale meta-analysis of 63 studies, which included a total of 187,181 subjects (86,585 cases and 100,596 controls). The results of our meta-analysis revealed that the C allele of rs4464148 [CC vs. TT+TC, odds ratio (OR) =1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-1.33, P &lt; 0.01], the T allele of rs4939827 [TT vs. CC+TC, odds ratio OR=1.15, 95%CI:1.07-1.22, P &lt; 0.01] and the T allele of rs12953717 [TT vs. CC+TC, OR =1.22, 95%CI:1.16-1.29, P &lt; 0.01] were all associated with the increased CRC risk. Subgroup analysis according to ethnicity showed rs4464148 and rs12953717 were associated with the risk of CRC in both Caucasians and Asians, whereas rs4939827 was a risk polymorphism for CRC specifically in Caucasians. In summary, this large-scale meta-analysis indicated that SMAD7 polymorphisms (rs4464148, rs4939827, and rs12953717) correlate with CRC.	NA	0
28072871	Atrophic and Metaplastic Progression in the Background Mucosa of Patients with Gastric Adenoma.	BACKGROUND: In patients with adenoma, assessing premalignant changes in the surrounding mucosa is important for surveillance. This study evaluated atrophic and metaplastic progression in the background mucosa of adenoma or early gastric cancer (EGC) cases.METHODS: Among 146 consecutive patients who underwent endoscopic resection for intestinal-type gastric neoplasia, the adenoma group included 56 patients with low-grade dysplasia and the ECG group included 90 patients with high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma. For histology, 3 paired biopsies were obtained from the antrum, corpus lesser curvature (CLC), and corpus greater curvature (CGC). Serological atrophy was determined based on pepsinogen A (PGA), progastricsin (PGC), gastrin-17, and total ghrelin levels. Topographic progression of atrophy and/or metaplasia was staged using the operative link on gastritis assessment (OLGA) and operative link on gastric intestinal metaplasia assessment (OLGIM) systems.RESULTS: Rates of moderate-to-marked histological atrophy/metaplasia in patients with adenoma were 52.7%/78.2% at the antrum (vs. 58.8%/76.4% in EGC group), 63.5%/75.0% at the CLC (vs. 60.2%/69.7% in EGC group), and 10.9%/17.9% at the CGC (vs. 5.6%/7.8% in EGC group). Serological atrophy indicated by PGA and PGC occurred in 23.2% and 15.6% of cases in the adenoma and ECG groups, respectively (p = 0.25). Mean serum gastrin-17 concentrations of the adenoma group and EGC group were 10.4 and 9.0 pmol/L, respectively (p = 0.54). Mean serum total ghrelin levels were 216.6 and 209.5 pg/mL, respectively (p = 0.71). Additionally, between group rates of stage III-IV OLGA and OLGIM were similar (25.9% vs. 25.0%, p = 0.90; 41.8% vs. 44.9%, p = 0.71, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Atrophic and metaplastic progression is extensive and severe in gastric adenoma patients. A surveillance strategy for metachronous tumors should be applied similarly for patients with adenoma or EGC.	NA	0
28072864	1H NMR Metabolomics Reveals Association of High Expression of Inositol 1, 4, 5 Trisphosphate Receptor and Metabolites in Breast Cancer Patients.	1H NMR is used to detect alterations in metabolites and their linkage to metabolic processes in a number of pathological conditions including breast cancer. Inositol 1, 4, 5 trisphosphate (IP3R) receptor is an intracellular calcium channel known to regulate metabolism and cellular bioenergetics. Its expression is up regulated in a number of cancers. However, its linkage to metabolism in disease conditions has not been evaluated. This study was designed to determine the association if any, of these metabolites with altered expression of IP3R in breast cancer. We used 1H NMR to identify metabolites in the serum of breast cancer patients (n = 27) and performed Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis for quantifying the expression of IP3R type 3 and type 2 in tissues from breast cancer patients (n = 40). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) clearly distinguished patients with high/low IP3R expression from healthy subjects. The present study revealed high expression of IP3R type 2 and type 3 in human breast tumor tissue compared to adjacent non-tumorous tissue. Moreover, patients with ≥ 2-fold increase in IP3R (high IP3R group) had significantly higher concentration of metabolic intermediates compared to those with &lt; 2-fold increase in IP3R (low IP3R group). We observed an increase in lipoprotein content and the levels of metabolites like lactate, lysine and alanine and a decrease in the levels of pyruvate and glucose in serum of high IP3R group patients when compared to those in healthy subjects. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to show the clinical utility of metabolites. In addition to the human studies, functional relevance of IP3Rs in causing metabolic disruption was observed in MCF-7 and MDA MB-231 cells. Results from our studies bring forth the importance of metabolic (or metabolomics) profiling of serum by 1H NMR in conjunction with tissue expression studies for characterizing breast cancer patients. The results from this study provide new insights into relationship of breast cancer metabolites with IP3R.	NA	0
28072858	Proton Pump Inhibitors Do Not Reduce the Risk of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma in Patients with Barrett's Esophagus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	OBJECTIVES: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been used for treatment of Barrett's esophagus (BE) for many years. However, the connection between PPIs and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in patients with BE has still been controversial. The current systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to evaluate the association between PPIs and the risk of EAC or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in patients with BE.METHODS: A systematic literature search of studies reporting the association between PPIs and the risk of EAC and/or HGD in patients with BE was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. Next, literature was screened using previously established criteria and relevant data were extracted from included studies. Finally, the software program Review Manage 5.2 was applied to aggregate data and analyze the results.RESULTS: Nine observational studies, comprising five cohort and four case-control studies (including a total of 5712 patients with BE), were identified. Upon meta-analysis, PPIs were found to have no association with the risk of EAC and/or HGD in patients with BE (unadjusted OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17-1.08). Analysis for duration response relationship revealed no significant trend toward protection against EAC or HGD with PPIs usage for &gt;2~3 years (one study using 7-year cutoff) when compared to usage for shorter time periods (PPIs usage &gt;2~3 years vs. &lt;2~3 years: OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.25-3.31) vs. 0.91 (0.40-2.07)).There also was considerable heterogeneity between studies.CONCLUSION: No dysplasia- or cancer-protective effects of PPIs usage in patients with BE were identified by our analysis. Therefore, we conclude that clinicians who discuss the potential chemopreventive effects of PPIs with their patients, should be aware that such an effect, if exists, has not been proven with statistical significance.

28072848	Physiologic Determinants of Exercise Capacity in Pulmonary Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis: A Multidimensional Analysis.	BACKGROUND: Reduced exercise capacity severely impacts quality of life in pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Ascertaining mechanisms that impair exercise capacity is necessary to identify targets for symptomatic treatments.METHODS: Dyspnea, pulmonary function tests and cardiopulmonary exercise test were analysed in 62 study participants. Data were compared between subjects with impaired and normal aerobic capacity (V'O2 peak less than 84% versus 84% predicted or more). Data were reduced using a principal component analysis. Multivariate analysis included V'O2 peak as the dependent variable and principal components as covariates.RESULTS: V'O2 peak was reduced in 44 subjects (71%). Subjects with impaired aerobic capacity presented: (i) decreased FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, DLCO and DLCO/VA and increased AaDO2, (ii) increased ventilatory equivalents at ventilatory threshold, VD/VT peak, AaDO2 peak and PaCO2 peak and decreased ventilatory reserve and PaO2 peak. There was no difference between groups in dyspnea scores. Principal component analysis extracted 4 principal components interpreted as follows: PC1: gas exchange; PC2: &quot;pseudorestriction&quot;; PC3: exercise-induced hyperpnea; PC4: air trapping. Multivariate analysis explained 65% of V'O2 peak. The 4 principal components were independently associated with V'O2 peak (βcoefficients: PC1: 9.3 [4.6; 14], PC2: 7.5 [3; 11.9], PC3: -5.3 [-9.6;-1.], PC4: -9.8 [-14,9;-4.7]).CONCLUSION: Impaired exercise capacity is frequent in pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It is mainly caused by pulmonary changes but is not associated with increased dyspnea intensity. Therefore, treating the lung represents a relevant approach for improving exercise capacity, even in patients experiencing mild dyspnea.	NA	0
28072832	Objectively Assessed Exercise Behavior in Chinese Patients with Early-Stage Cancer: A Predictor of Perceived Benefits, Communication with Doctors, Medical Coping Modes, Depression and Quality of Life.	This study sought to identify factors associated with objectively assessed exercise behavior in Chinese patients with early-stage cancer. Three hundred and fifty one cancer patients were recruited from the Affiliated Jiangyin Hospital of Southeast University Medical College and the Nantong Tumor Hospital. One-way ANOVA, Pearson Chi-square tests and regression analysis were employed to identify the correlations between physical exercise and the measured factors. The results showed that occupation type (χ2 = 14.065; p = 0.029), monthly individual monthly income level (χ2 = 24.795; p = 0.003), BMI (χ2 = 15.709; p = 0.015) and diagnosis (χ2 = 42.442; p &lt; 0.000) were significantly correlated with the subjects self-reported exercise with different frequency per week. Differences in the frequency of exercise were associated with different degrees of reported Benefit Finding (BF) (F = 24.651; p &lt; 0.000), communication with doctors (F = 15.285; p &lt; 0.000), medical coping modes (F = 45.912; p &lt; 0.000), social support (F = 2.938; p = 0.030), depression (F = 6.017; p &lt; 0.000), and quality of life (F = 12.288; p &lt; 0.000). Multiple regression analysis showed that 1.6%-6.4% of the variance in five variables, excluding social support and optimism could be explained by exercise. Our results indicated that benefit finding, medical coping modes, communication with doctors, social support, depression and quality of life were significantly correlated with exercise. The variance in several psychosocial factors (benefit finding, medical coping modes, the communication with doctors, depression and quality of life) could be explained by exercise. Psychosocial factors should be addressed and examined over time when evaluating the effect of physical exercise that is prescribed as a clinically relevant treatment.	NA	0
28072830	Protective Effects of Dexrazoxane against Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity: A Metabolomic Study.	Cardioprotection of dexrazoxane (DZR) against doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity is contentious and the indicator is controversial. A pairwise comparative metabolomics approach was used to delineate the potential metabolic processes in the present study. Ninety-six BALB/c mice were randomly divided into two supergroups: tumor and control groups. Each supergroup was divided into control, DOX, DZR, and DOX plus DZR treatment groups. DOX treatment resulted in a steady increase in 5-hydroxylysine, 2-hydroxybutyrate, 2-oxoglutarate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and decrease in glucose, glutamate, cysteine, acetone, methionine, asparate, isoleucine, and glycylproline.DZR treatment led to increase in lactate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, glutamate, alanine, and decrease in glucose, trimethylamine N-oxide and carnosine levels. These metabolites represent potential biomarkers for early prediction of cardiotoxicity of DOX and the cardioprotective evaluation of DZR.	NA	0
28072827	Comprehensive N-Glycan Profiling of Cetuximab Biosimilar Candidate by NP-HPLC and MALDI-MS.	Monitoring glycosylation of the mAbs have been emphasized and routinely characterized in biopharmaceutical industries because the carbohydrate components are closely related to the safety, efficacy, and consistency of the antibodies. In this study, the comprehensive glycan profiling of a biosimilar candidate of cetuximab was successfully characterized using Normal phase high-performance liquid chromatography (NP-HPLC) in combination with Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The presence of minor N-linked glycans containing sialic acid lactone residues (NeuAcLac) was observed in the biosimilar for the first time, which could influence the quantitative analysis of sialylated glycans and interfere with quantification of neutral glycans when it was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography fluorescence (HPLC-FL). To overcome this issue, mild alkali treatment was used to hydrolyze lactone of the sialic acid to their neutral formation, which had no impact on the analysis of other glycans before and after the treatment. As a result, the mild alkali treatment might be helpful to obtain quantitative glycan profiling of the mAbs drugs with enhanced accuracy and robustness.	NA	0
28073006	BCL9L Dysfunction Impairs Caspase-2 Expression Permitting Aneuploidy Tolerance in Colorectal Cancer.	Chromosomal instability (CIN) contributes to cancer evolution, intratumor heterogeneity, and drug resistance. CIN is driven by chromosome segregation errors and a tolerance phenotype that permits the propagation of aneuploid genomes. Through genomic analysis of colorectal cancers and cell lines, we find frequent loss of heterozygosity and mutations in BCL9L in aneuploid tumors. BCL9L deficiency promoted tolerance of chromosome missegregation events, propagation of aneuploidy, and genetic heterogeneity in xenograft models likely through modulation of Wnt signaling. We find that BCL9L dysfunction contributes to aneuploidy tolerance in both TP53-WT and mutant cells by reducing basal caspase-2 levels and preventing cleavage of MDM2 and BID. Efforts to exploit aneuploidy tolerance mechanisms and the BCL9L/caspase-2/BID axis may limit cancer diversity and evolution.	NA	0
28073005	Simultaneous Inhibition of PI3Kδ and PI3Kα Induces ABC-DLBCL Regression by Blocking BCR-Dependent and -Independent Activation of NF-κB and AKT.	Compared with follicular lymphoma, high PI3Kα expression was more prevalent in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), although both tumor types expressed substantial PI3Kδ. Simultaneous inhibition of PI3Kα and PI3Kδ dramatically enhanced the anti-tumor profile in ABC-DLBCL models compared with selective inhibition of PI3Kδ, PI3Kα, or BTK. The anti-tumor activity was associated with suppression of p-AKT and a mechanism of blocking nuclear factor-κB activation driven by CD79(mut), CARD11(mut), TNFAIP3(mut), or MYD88(mut). Inhibition of PI3Kα/δ resulted in tumor regression in an ibrutinib-resistant CD79B(WT)/MYD88(mut) patient-derived ABC-DLBCL model. Furthermore, rebound activation of BTK and AKT was identified as a mechanism limiting CD79B(mut)-ABC-DLBCL to show a robust response to PI3K and BTK inhibitor monotherapies. A combination of ibrutinib with the PI3Kα/δ inhibitor copanlisib produced a sustained complete response in vivo in CD79B(mut)/MYD88(mut) ABC-DLBCL models.	NA	2
28073004	Epigenetic siRNA and Chemical Screens Identify SETD8 Inhibition as a Therapeutic Strategy for p53 Activation in High-Risk Neuroblastoma.	Given the paucity of druggable mutations in high-risk neuroblastoma (NB), we undertook chromatin-focused small interfering RNA and chemical screens to uncover epigenetic regulators critical for the differentiation block in high-risk NB. High-content Opera imaging identified 53 genes whose loss of expression led to a decrease in NB cell proliferation and 16 also induced differentiation. From these, the secondary chemical screen identified SETD8, the H4(K20me1) methyltransferase, as a druggable NB target. Functional studies revealed that SETD8 ablation rescued the pro-apoptotic and cell-cycle arrest functions of p53 by decreasing p53(K382me1), leading to activation of the p53 canonical pathway. In pre-clinical xenograft NB models, genetic or pharmacological (UNC0379) SETD8 inhibition conferred a significant survival advantage, providing evidence for SETD8 as a therapeutic target in NB.	therapeutic	1
28073003	Employing Metabolism to Improve the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer.	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is on pace to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death. The high mortality rate results from a lack of methods for early detection and the inability to successfully treat patients once diagnosed. Pancreatic cancer cells have extensively reprogrammed metabolism, which is driven by oncogene-mediated cell-autonomous pathways, the unique physiology of the tumor microenvironment, and interactions with non-cancer cells. In this review, we discuss how recent efforts delineating rewired metabolic networks in pancreatic cancer have revealed new in-roads to develop detection and treatment strategies for this dreadful disease.

28072768	Effect of low-dose aspirin use on survival of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies; an observational study.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested a relationship between aspirin use and mortality reduction. The mechanism for the effect of aspirin on cancer outcomes remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate aspirin use and survival in patients with gastrointestinal tract cancer.METHODS: Patients with gastrointestinal tract cancer diagnosed between 1998 and 2011 were included. The population-based Eindhoven Cancer Registry was linked to drug-dispensing data from the PHARMO Database Network. The association between aspirin use after diagnosis and overall survival was analysed using Cox regression models.RESULTS: In total, 13 715 patients were diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancer. A total of 1008 patients were identified as aspirin users, and 8278 patients were identified as nonusers. The adjusted hazard ratio for aspirin users vs nonusers was 0.52 (95% CI 0.44-0.63). A significant association between aspirin use and survival was observed for patients with oesophageal, hepatobiliary and colorectal cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Post-diagnosis use of aspirin in patients with gastrointestinal tract malignancies is associated with increased survival in cancers with different sites of origin and biology. This adds weight to the hypothesis that the anti-cancer effects of aspirin are not tumour-site specific and may be modulated through the tumour micro-environment.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication 10 January 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2016.425 www.bjcancer.com.

28072767	CYP3A7*1C allele is associated with reduced levels of 2-hydroxylation pathway oestrogen metabolites.	BACKGROUND: Endogenous sex hormones are well-established risk factors for breast cancer; the contribution of specific oestrogen metabolites (EMs) and/or ratios of specific EMs is less clear. We have previously identified a CYP3A7*1C allele that is associated with lower urinary oestrone (E1) levels in premenopausal women. The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether this allele was associated with specific pathway EMs.METHODS: We measured successfully 12 EMs in mid-follicular phase urine samples from 30 CYP3A7*1C carriers and 30 non-carriers using HPLC-MS/MS.RESULTS: In addition to having lower urinary E1 levels, CYP3A7*1C carriers had significantly lower levels of four of the 2-hydroxylation pathway EMs that we measured (2-hydroxyestrone, P=1.1 × 10(-12); 2-hydroxyestradiol, P=2.7 × 10(-7); 2-methoxyestrone, P=1.9 × 10(-12); and 2-methoxyestradiol, P=0.0009). By contrast, 16α-hydroxylation pathway EMs were slightly higher in carriers and significantly so for 17-epiestriol (P=0.002).CONCLUSIONS: The CYP3A7*1C allele is associated with a lower urinary E1 levels, a more pronounced reduction in 2-hydroxylation pathway EMs and a lower ratio of 2-hydroxylation:16α-hydroxylation EMs in premenopausal women. To further characterise the association between parent oestrogens, EMs and subsequent risk of breast cancer, characterisation of additional genetic variants that influence oestrogen metabolism and large prospective studies of a broad spectrum of EMs will be required.British Journal of Canceradvance online publication, 10 January 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2016.432 www.bjcancer.com.

28072766	The impact of body composition parameters on ipilimumab toxicity and survival in patients with metastatic melanoma.	BACKGROUND: Body composition is an important predictor of drug toxicity and outcome. Ipilimumab (Ipi), a monoclonal antibody used to treat metastatic melanoma, has specific toxicities. No validated biomarkers that predict Ipi toxicity and efficacy exist. Also, the impact of Ipi on body composition has not been established.METHODS: Patients with metastatic melanoma treated with Ipi between 2009 and 2015 were included. Body composition was assessed by computed tomography at baseline and after four cycles of Ipi. Sarcopenia and low muscle attenuation (MA) were defined using published cut-points. All adverse events (AEs) and immune-related AEs (irAEs) were recorded (Common Terminology Criteria For Adverse Event V.4.0).RESULTS: Eighty-four patients were included in this study (62% male, median age 54 years). At baseline, 24% were sarcopenic and 33% had low MA. On multivariate analysis, sarcopenia and low MA were significantly associated with high-grade AEs (OR=5.34, 95% CI: 1.15-24.88, P=0.033; OR=5.23, 95% CI: 1.41-19.30, P=0.013, respectively), and low MA was associated with high-grade irAEs (OR=3.57, 95% CI: 1.09-11.77, P=0.036). Longitudinal analysis (n=59) revealed significant reductions in skeletal muscle area (SMA), total body fat-free mass, fat mass (all P&lt;0.001) and MA (P=0.030). Mean reduction in SMA was 3.3%/100 days (95% CI: -4.48 to -1.79%, P&lt;0.001). A loss of SMA ⩾7.5%/100 days (highest quartile) was a significant predictor of overall survival in multivariable Cox regression analysis (HR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.02-4.56, P=0.046).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with sarcopenia and low MA are more likely to experience severe treatment-related toxicity to Ipi. Loss of muscle during treatment was predictive of worse survival. Treatments to increase muscle mass and influence outcome warrant further investigation.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 10 January 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2016.431 www.bjcancer.comPublished online 10 January 2017.

28072765	Phase II study of the PI3K inhibitor BKM120 in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma: a stratified type I-type II study from the GINECO group.	Backround:Patients with metastatic endometrial carcinoma have a poor prognosis and PIK3CA mutations and amplifications are common in these cancers. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the pure PI3K inhibitor BKM120 in advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma.METHODS: This phase II, multicentre, single-arm, double strata (histological low grade (LG) or high grade (HG)) open-label study enrolled patients with histologically confirmed advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma who had received not more than one prior chemotherapy regimen. Patients received initially BKM120 100 mg tablets once daily. Primary end points were proportion of patients free of progression at 2 months (HG strata) or at 3 months (LG strata), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled, of whom 16 patients had received BKM120 at 100 mg. Because of high toxicities (cutaneous rash (54%), depressive events (47%), and anxiety (40%), the IDMC has proposed to stop recruitment at 100 mg and to continue the clinical trial with a lower dose of 60 mg per day. In addition, 24 patients (median age 67 years old) were newly enrolled (14 in the LG strata and 10 in the HG strata). Rate of nonprogression at 2 months in the HG strata was 70% and at 3 months was 60% in the LG strata. Median progression-free survival (PFS) for all patients is 4.5 months (CI 95% 2.8-6.1), and the median PFS for LG strata is 8.3 months compared with 3.8 months for the HG strata. No response was reported. At 60 mg per day, the most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were hyperglycaemia (58%), cognitive (31%), digestive (28%), hepatic liver functions (26%), and rash (23%). The most commonly reported treatment-related grade ⩾3 AEs were HTA (17%), hyperglycaemia (17%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (24%). Five patients (21%) stopped BKM120 for toxicity.CONCLUSIONS: The BKM120 was associated with an unfavourable safety profile and minimal antitumour activity in monotherapy in advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The clinical trial was stopped before end of recruitment for toxicity.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication 10 January 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2016.430 www.bjcancer.com.	therapeutic	1
28072764	Antitumour activity of trabectedin in myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms.	BACKGROUND: Juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) are myelodysplastic myeloproliferative (MDS/MPN) neoplasms with unfavourable prognosis and without effective chemotherapy treatment. Trabectedin is a DNA minor groove binder acting as a modulator of transcription and interfering with DNA repair mechanisms; it causes selective depletion of cells of the myelomonocytic lineage. We hypothesised that trabectedin might have an antitumour effect on MDS/MPN.METHODS: Malignant CD14+ monocytes and CD34+ haematopoietic progenitor cells were isolated from peripheral blood/bone marrow mononuclear cells. The inhibition of CFU-GM colonies and the apoptotic effect on CD14+ and CD34+ induced by trabectedin were evaluated. Trabectedin's effects were also investigated in vitro on THP-1, and in vitro and in vivo on MV-4-11 cell lines.RESULTS: On CMML/JMML cells, obtained from 20 patients with CMML and 13 patients with JMML, trabectedin - at concentration pharmacologically reasonable, 1-5 nM - strongly induced apoptosis and inhibition of growth of haematopoietic progenitors (CFU-GM). In these leukaemic cells, trabectedin downregulated the expression of genes belonging to the Rho GTPases pathway (RAS superfamily) having a critical role in cell growth and cytoskeletal dynamics. Its selective activity on myelomonocytic malignant cells was confirmed also on in vitro THP-1 cell line and on in vitro and in vivo MV-4-11 cell line models.CONCLUSIONS: Trabectedin could be good candidate for clinical studies in JMML/CMML patients.British Journal of Canceradvance online publication, 10 January 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2016.424 www.bjcancer.com.

28072763	Epithelial to mesenchymal transition and HPV infection in squamous cell oropharyngeal carcinomas: the papillophar study.	BACKGROUND: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is recognised as aetiological factor of carcinogenesis in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPC). HPV-related OPC respond better to treatments and have a significantly favourable outcome. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) implicated in tumour invasion, is a hallmark of a poor prognosis in carcinomas.METHODS: We have studied the relationship of EMT markers (E-cadherin, β-catenin and vimentin) with HPV infection (DNA and E6/E7 mRNA detection), p16(INK4a) expression and survival outcomes in a cohort of 296 patients with OPC.RESULTS: Among the 296 OPSSC, 26% were HPV positive, 20.3% had overt EMT (&gt;25% of vimentin positive tumour cells). Lower E-cadherin expression was associated with a higher risk of distant metastasis in univariate (P=0.0110) and multivariate analyses (hazard ratios (HR)=6.86 (1.98; 23.84)). Vimentin expression tends towards worse metastasis-free survival (MFS; HR=2.53 (1.00; 6.41)) and was an independent prognostic factor of progression-free survival (HR=1.55 (1.03; 2.34)).CONCLUSIONS: There was a non significant association of EMT with HPV status. This may be explained by a mixed subpopulation of patients HPV positive with associated risk factors (HPV, tobacco and alcohol). Thus, the detection of EMT in OPC represents another reliable approach in the prognosis and the management of OPC whatever their HPV status.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 10 January 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2016.434 www.bjcancer.comPublished online 10 January 2017.

28072762	Giving AXL the axe: targeting AXL in human malignancy.	The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, activated by a complex interaction between its ligand growth arrest-specific protein 6 and phosphatidylserine, regulates various vital cellular processes, including proliferation, survival, motility, and immunologic response. Although not implicated as an oncogenic driver itself, AXL, a member of the TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed in several haematologic and solid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukaemia, non-small cell lung cancer, gastric and colorectal adenocarcinomas, and breast and prostate cancers. In the context of malignancy, evidence suggests that AXL overexpression drives wide-ranging processes, including epithelial to mesenchymal transition, tumour angiogenesis, resistance to chemotherapeutic and targeted agents, and decreased antitumor immune response. As a result, AXL is an attractive candidate not only as a prognostic biomarker in malignancy but also as a target for anticancer therapies. Several AXL inhibitors are currently in preclinical and clinical development.

28072761	Immediate chest X-ray for patients at risk of lung cancer presenting in primary care: randomised controlled feasibility trial.	BACKGROUND: Achieving earlier stage diagnosis is one option for improving lung cancer outcomes in the United Kingdom. Patients with lung cancer typically present with symptoms to general practitioners several times before referral or investigation.METHODS: We undertook a mixed methods feasibility individually randomised controlled trial (the ELCID trial) to assess the feasibility and inform the design of a definitive, fully powered, UK-wide, Phase III trial of lowering the threshold for urgent investigation of suspected lung cancer. Patients over 60, with a smoking history, presenting with new chest symptoms to primary care, were eligible to be randomised to intervention (urgent chest X-ray) or usual care.RESULTS: The trial design and materials were acceptable to GPs and patients. We randomised 255 patients from 22 practices, although the proportion of eligible patients who participated was lower than expected. Survey responses (89%), and the fidelity of the intervention (82% patients X-rayed within 3 weeks) were good. There was slightly higher anxiety and depression in the control arm in participants aged &gt;75. Three patients (1.2%) were diagnosed with lung cancer.CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the feasibility of individually randomising patients at higher risk of lung cancer, to a trial offering urgent investigation or usual care.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication 10 January 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2016.414 www.bjcancer.com.

28069878	MALAT1 is associated with poor response to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer patients and promotes chemoresistance through EZH2.	A major reason for oxaliplatin chemoresistance in colorectal cancer (CRC) is the acquisition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells. The long non-coding RNA, MALAT1, is a highly conserved nuclear ncRNA and a key regulator of metastasis development in several cancers. However, its role in oxaliplatin-induced metastasis and chemo-resistance is not well known. In this study, we aim to investigate the prognostic and therapeutic role of MALAT1 in CRC patients receiving oxaliplatin-based therapy, and further explore the potential transcriptional regulation through interaction with EZH2 based on the established HT29 oxaliplatin-resistant cells. Our results showed that high MALAT1 expression was associated with reduced patient survival and poor response to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in advanced CRC patients. Oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cells exhibited high MALAT1 expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). LncRNA MALAT1 knockdown enhances E-cadherin expression and inhibits oxaliplatin-induced EMT in CRC cells. EZH2 is highly expressed and associated with the 3' end region of lncRNA MALAT1 in CRC, and this association suppressed the expression of E-cadhrin. Furthermore, targeted inhibition of MALAT1 or EZH2 reversed EMT and chemoresistance induced by oxaliplatin. Finally, the interaction between lncRNA MALAT1 and miR-218 was observed, which further indicated its prognostic value in patients who received standard FOLFOX (oxaliplatin combine with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin) treatment. In conclusion, this study illuminates the prognostic role of lncRNA MALAT1 in CRC patients receiving oxaliplatin-based treatment and further demonstrates how lncRNA MALAT1 confers a chemoresistant function in CRC. Thus, lncRNA MALAT1 may serve as a promising prognostic and therapeutic target for CRC patients.	therapeutic	1
28069877	Bone seeking matrix metalloproteinase-2 inhibitors prevent bone metastatic breast cancer growth.	Bone metastasis is common during breast cancer progression. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is significantly associated with aggressive breast cancer and poorer overall survival. In bone, tumor or host derived MMP-2 contributes to breast cancer growth and does so by processing substrates including type I collagen and transforming growth factorβ (TGFβ) latency proteins. These data provide strong rationale for the application of MMP-2 inhibitors to treat the disease. However, in vivo, MMP-2 is systemically expressed. Therefore, to overcome potential toxicities noted with previous broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors (MMPIs), we used highly selective bisphosphonic based MMP-2 inhibitors (BMMPIs) that allowed for specific bone targeting. In vitro, BMMPIs impacted the viability of breast cancer cell lines and osteoclast precursors but not osteoblasts. In vivo, we demonstrated using two bone metastatic models (PyMT-R221A and 4T1) that BMMPI treatment significantly reduced tumor growth and tumor associated bone destruction. Additionally, BMMPIs are superior in promoting tumor apoptosis compared to the standard of care bisphosphonate, zoledronate. We demonstrated MMP-2 selective inhibition in the bone microenvironment using specific and broad spectrum MMP probes. Further, compared to zoledronate, BMMPI treated mice had significantly lower levels of TGFβ signaling and MMP generated type I collagen carboxy-terminal (ICTP) fragments. Taken together, our data show the feasibility of selective inhibition of MMPs in the bone metastatic breast cancer microenvironment. We posit that BMMPIs could be easily translated to the clinical setting for the treatment of bone metastases given the well-tolerated nature of bisphosphonates.	NA	2
28069876	Targeting Plk1 to enhance efficacy of Olaparib in castration-resistant prostate cancer.	Olaparib is a FDA-approved PARP inhibitor (PARPi) that has shown promise as a synthetic lethal treatment approach for BRCA-mutant castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in clinical use. However, emerging data has also shown that even BRCA-mutant cells may be resistant to PARPi. The mechanistic basis for these drug resistances is poorly understood. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a critical regulator of many cell cycle events, is significantly elevated upon castration of mice carrying xenograft prostate tumors. Herein, by combination with Plk1 inhibitor BI2536, we show a robust sensitization of Olaparib in 22RV1, a BRCA1 deficient CRPC cell line, as well as in CRPC xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, monotherapy with Olaparib results in an override of the G1/S checkpoint, leading to high expression of Plk1, which attenuates Olaparib's overall efficacy. In BRCA1 wild type C4-2 cells, Plk1 inhibition also significantly increases the efficacy of Olaparib in the presence of p53 inhibitor. Collectively, our findings not only implicate the critical role of Plk1 in PARPi resistance in BRCA-mutant CRPC cells, but also shed new light on the treatment of non-BRCA-mutant patient subgroups who might also respond favorably to PARPi.	therapeutic	1
28069875	15∝-methoxypuupehenol induces antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo against human glioblastoma and breast cancer models.	Studies with 15∝-methoxypuupehenol (15∝-MP), obtained from the extracts of Hyrtios sp., identified putative targets that are associated with its antitumor effects against human glioblastoma (GBM) and breast cancer. In the human GBM (U251MG) or breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells, treatment with 15∝-MP repressed pY705Stat3 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3), pErk1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), pS147CyclinB1, pY507Alk (Anaplastic lymphoma kinase), and pY478ezrin levels, and induced pS10merlin, without inhibiting pJAK2 (Janus kinase) or pAkt induction. 15∝-MP treatment induced loss of viability of breast cancer (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468) and GBM (U251MG) lines and GBM patient-derived xenograft cells (G22) that harbor aberrantly-active Stat3, with only moderate or little effect on the human breast cancer, MCF7, colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2, normal human lung fibroblast, WI-38, or normal mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF Stat3fl/fl) lines that do not harbor constitutively-active Stat3, or the Stat3 null (Stat3-/-) mouse astrocytes. 15∝-MP-treated U251MG cells have severely impaired F-actin organization and altered morphology, including the cells rounding up, and undergo apoptosis, compared to a moderate, reversible morphology change observed for similarly-treated mouse astrocytes. Treatment further inhibited U251MG or MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, colony formation, and migration in vitro, while only moderately or weakly affecting MCF7 cells or normal mouse astrocytes. Oral gavage delivery of 15∝-MP inhibited the growth of U251MG subcutaneous tumor xenografts in mice, associated with apoptosis in the treated tumor tissues. Results together suggest the modulation of Stat3, CyclinB1, Alk, ezrin, merlin, and Erk1/2 functions contributes to the antitumor effects of 15∝-MP against GBM and breast cancer progression.	NA	0
28069874	Dimethyl fumarate controls the NRF2/DJ-1 axis in cancer cells: therapeutic applications.	The transcription factor NRF2 (NFE2L2), regulates important antioxidant and cytoprotective genes. It enhances cancer cell proliferation and promotes chemoresistance in several cancers. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is known to promote NRF2 activity in non-cancer models. We combined in vitro and in vivo methods to examine the effect of DMF on cancer cell death and the activation of the NRF2 antioxidant pathway. We demonstrated that at lower concentrations (&lt; 25 μM), DMF has a cytoprotective role through activation of the NRF2 antioxidant pathway. At higher concentrations, however (&gt; 25 μM), DMF caused oxidative stress and subsequently cytotoxicity in several cancer cell lines. High DMF concentration decreases nuclear translocation of NRF2 and production of its downstream targets. The pro-oxidative and cytotoxic effects of high concentration of DMF were abrogated by over-expression of NRF2 in OVCAR3 cells, suggesting that DMF cytotoxicity is dependent of NRF2 depletion. High concentrations of DMF decreased the expression of DJ-1, a NRF2 protein stabiliser. Using DJ-1 siRNA and expression vector, we observed that the expression level of DJ-1 controls NRF2 activation, antoxidant defences and cell death in OVCAR3 cells. Finally, antitumoral effect of daily DMF (20 mg/kg) was also observed in vivo in two mice models of colon cancer. Taken together, these findings implicate the effect of DJ-1 on NRF2 in cancer development and identify DMF as a dose dependant modulator of both NRF2 and DJ-1, which may be useful in exploiting the therapeutic potential of these endogenous antioxidants.

28069963	Pathogen boosted adoptive cell transfer immunotherapy to treat solid tumors.	Because of insufficient migration and antitumor function of transferred T cells, especially inside the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), the efficacy of adoptive cell transfer (ACT) is much curtailed in treating solid tumors. To overcome these challenges, we sought to reenergize ACT (ReACT) with a pathogen-based cancer vaccine. To bridge ACT with a pathogen, we genetically engineered tumor-specific CD8 T cells in vitro with a second T-cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes a bacterial antigen. We then transferred these dual-specific T cells in combination with intratumoral bacteria injection to treat solid tumors in mice. The dual-specific CD8 T cells expanded vigorously, migrated to tumor sites, and robustly eradicated primary tumors. The mice cured from ReACT also developed immunological memory against tumor rechallenge. Mechanistically, we have found that this combined approach reverts the immunosuppressive TME and recruits CD8 T cells with an increased number and killing ability to the tumors.	NA	0
28073170	Loss of hSef promotes metastasis through up-regulation of EMT in prostate cancer.	We have previously reported that the negative regulator Similar Expression to FGF (hSef) is down-regulated in prostate cancer and its loss is associated with clinical metastasis. Here, we explored the mechanistic basis of this finding. We first confirmed our clinical observation by testing hSef manipulation in an in vivo metastasis model. hSef stable expressing cells (PC3M-hSef) or empty vector controls (PC3M-EV) were injected subcutaneously into the lateral thoracic walls of NOD-SCID gamma mice and lungs were harvested at autopsy. In this model, 6/7 PC3M-EV xenografts had definitive lung micro-metastasis whilst only 1/6 PC3M-hSef xenografts exhibited metastasis recapitulating the clinical scenario (p=0.03). Gene expression studies revealed key perturbations in genes involved in cell motility and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) along with alterations in cognate signalling pathways. These results were validated in an EMT specific PCR array whereby hSef over-expression and silencing reciprocally altered E-Cadherin expression (p=&lt;0.001) amongst other EMT markers. Immunohistochemistry of excised tumours from the xenografts also confirmed the effect of hSef in suppressing E-Cadherin expression at the protein level. Phosphokinase arrays further demonstrated a role for hSef in attenuating signalling of not only ERK-MAPK but also the JNK and p38 pathways as well. Taken together, these data suggest evidence that loss of hSef may be a critical event facilitating tumour dissemination of prostate cancer through alteration of EMT. Detection of down-regulated hSef, along with other negative regulators, may therefore be a useful biomarker heralding a transition to a metastatic phenotype and warrants further exploration in this context.

28073150	The impact of overdiagnosis on the selection of efficient lung cancer screening strategies.	The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently updated their national lung screening guidelines and recommended low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer (LC) screening through age 80. However, the risk of overdiagnosis among older populations is a concern. Using four comparative models from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network, we evaluate the overdiagnosis of the screening program recommended by USPSTF in the U.S. 1950 birth cohort. We estimate the number of LC deaths averted by screening (D) per overdiagnosed case (O), yielding the ratio D/O, to quantify the trade-off between the harms and benefits of LDCT. We analyze 576 hypothetical screening strategies that vary by age, smoking, and screening frequency and evaluate efficient screening strategies that maximize the D/O ratio and other metrics including D and life-years gained (LYG) per overdiagnosed case. The estimated D/O ratio for the USPSTF screening program is 2.85 (model range: 1.5-4.5) in the 1950 birth cohort, implying LDCT can prevent ∼3 LC deaths per overdiagnosed case. This D/O ratio increases by 22% when the program stops screening at an earlier age 75 instead of 80. Efficiency frontier analysis shows that while the most efficient screening strategies that maximize the mortality reduction (D) irrespective of overdiagnosis screen through age 80, screening strategies that stop at age 75 versus 80 produce greater efficiency in increasing life-years gained per overdiagnosed case. Given the risk of overdiagnosis with lung cancer screening, the stopping age of screening merits further consideration when balancing benefits and harms. This article is protected by copyright.

28073149	Smoking at the time of diagnosis and mortality in cancer patients: What benefit does the quitter gain?	Few studies have examined the association between smoking behavior (especially quitters) at the time of diagnosis and mortality among cancer patients. Our objective was to examine the benefits of quitting on all-cause mortality among cancer patients. 30,658 eligible cancer patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2009, identified by a hospital-based cancer registry in Japan, were followed up for up to 10 years. We evaluated smoking behavior at cancer diagnosis (especially recent quitters versus current smokers) in association with all-cause mortality using Cox-proportional hazards models and covariates-adjusted survival curves. Risk of death was estimated to be reduced by 11% in recent quitters compared to current smokers. According to adjusted survival curves, median survival time was 8.25 years for recent quitters versus 7.18 years for current smokers, indicating an absolute difference of 1.07 year for a median survivor. Similarly, never and former smokers had 18% and 16% lower risk of death with 1.90 years and 1.77 years gained, respectively, compared to current smokers. In addition to former and never smokers, recent quitters showed consistently higher survival rates than current smokers during the 10-year calendar period after diagnosis among cancer patients. Because recent quitters may be similar to patients who stop smoking shortly after cancer diagnosis in terms of smoking duration, the latter may be able to decrease their risk of death, suggesting that smoking cessation could be part of cancer care.

28068959	Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with metastasis to the spleen: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Long-term term survival in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors has been reported, even in patients with metastatic disease. Metastases to the spleen are extremely rare, but have been reported from a number of primary malignancies, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma and ovarian cancer. This is the first report of a splenic metastasis from a primary pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented as a 53 years old white male with anemia and fatigue. Physical examination revealed a left upper quadrant fullness and computed tomography showed a 24 cm left upper quadrant mass with multiple liver metastases, splenomegaly and a 1 cm mass in the spleen. Resection of the primary pancreatic tumor (T4N0M1) was accompanied by gastrectomy, splenectomy and resection of adherent bowel. The spleen contained a metastatic lesion 1.0 cm in diameter, consistent with a primary neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas. This operation was followed 8 months later, by delayed resection of liver metastases. The patient receives monthly administration of somatostatin long-acting analogue and has undergone several ablations of liver lesions with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation as well as a second liver resection. The patient is alive seven years after initial presentation, with no evidence of disease on imaging studies.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a splenic metastasis from a primary pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. The patient initially presented with synchronous multiple liver metastases and a single splenic metastasis. After resection of the primary tumor and spleen, the patient has undergone aggressive cytoreductive surgery/ablation of liver lesions and somatostatin therapy with resulting long-term survival.	NA	0
28068944	The acceleration of glucose accumulation in renal cell carcinoma assessed by FDG PET/CT demonstrated acquisition of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.	BACKGROUND: Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting angiogenesis improves the prognosis of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but its effect is temporary. In order to understand the mechanism by which RCC acquires resistance to TKI, we investigated the change of glucose accumulation in RCC by FDG PET/CT when they demonstrated progression disease (PD) against TKI.METHODS: We monitored the FDG accumulation in RCC of 38 patients treated with TKI by 162 PET/CT sequentially until they were judged to demonstrate PD. Standardized uptake value (SUV), a simplified index of tissue FDG accumulation rate, was measured, and the sequential changes of max SUVmax (the highest SUV in an individual patient) was analyzed. Additionally, the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) and associated proteins in 786-O cells cultured under hypoxia were analyzed.RESULTS: The 10 patients with RCC which FDG accumulation was accelerated after beginning of TKI treatment demonstrated PD soon. The other 28 patients with RCC which FDG accumulation was suppressed by TKI showed longer progression-free survival (3.6 months vs 6.5 months, P = 0.0026), but this suppression in most cases (96%) was temporary and FDG accumulation was accelerated when tumor demonstrated PD. Interestingly, the FDG accumulation at PD was higher than that before TKI treatment in the half cases. The acceleration of FDG accumulation was suppressed by following treatment by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor. Additionally, in vitro assay demonstrated that the expression of GLUT-1 was increased in the RCC cells surviving under hypoxia condition via mTOR pathway.CONCLUSIONS: The acceleration of glucose accumulation dependent on mTOR in RCC assessed by FDG PET/CT demonstrated acquisition of resistance to TKI. FDG PET/CT had potential as an assessment method monitoring not only the initial response but also following status of RCC during TKI treatment.TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN0000008141 , 11 Jun 2012.

28068940	Early life socioeconomic environment and mammographic breast density.	BACKGROUND: Early life social environment may influence breast cancer through shaping risk factors operating in early life, adolescence and adulthood, or may be associated with breast cancer risk independent of known risk factors. We investigated the associations between early life socioeconomic status (SES) and mammographic density, a strong risk factor for breast cancer, and the extent to which these associations were independent of risk factors across the lifecourse.METHODS: We used data from an adult follow-up study of two U.S. birth cohorts of women (average age = 43 years) with prospectively collected data starting during the pregnancy of the mother and continuing through early childhood of the offspring. We collected data on factors in later life periods through computer-assisted interviews with the offspring as adults, and obtained routine clinical mammograms for measurement of percent density and dense and nondense breast areas using a computer assisted method. We used generalized estimating equation models for multivariable analysis to account for correlated data for sibling sets within the study sample (n = 700 composed of 441 individuals and 127 sibling sets).RESULTS: Highest vs. lowest family income level around the time of birth was associated with smaller dense breast area after adjustment for early life factors (e.g., birthweight, maternal smoking during pregnancy) and risk factors in later life periods, including adult body mass index (BMI) and adult SES (β = -8.2 cm(2), 95% confidence interval [CI]: -13.3, -3.2). Highest vs. lowest parental educational attainment was associated with higher percent density in models that adjusted for age at mammogram and adult BMI (e.g., β = 4.8, 95% CI = 0.6, 9.1 for maternal education of college or higher degree vs. less than high school), but the association was attenuated and no longer statistically significant after further adjustment for early life factors. There were no associations between early life SES indicators and non-dense area after adjustment for adult BMI. Neither adult education nor adult income was statistically significantly associated with any measure of mammographic density after adjusting for age and adult BMI.CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe consistent associations between different measures of early life SES and mammographic density in adulthood.

28068939	Swallowing interventions for the treatment of dysphagia after head and neck cancer: a systematic review of behavioural strategies used to promote patient adherence to swallowing exercises.	BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is a significant side-effect following treatment for head and neck cancers, yet poor adherence to swallowing exercises is frequently reported in intervention studies. Behaviour change techniques (BCTs) can be used to improve adherence, but no review to date has described the techniques or indicated which may be more associated with improved swallowing outcomes.METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify behavioural strategies in swallowing interventions, and to explore any relationships between these strategies and intervention effects. Randomised and quasi-randomised studies of head and neck cancer patients were included. Behavioural interventions to improve swallowing were eligible provided a valid measure of swallowing function was reported. A validated and comprehensive list of 93 discrete BCTs was used to code interventions. Analysis was conducted via a structured synthesis approach.RESULTS: Fifteen studies (8 randomised) were included, and 20 different BCTs were each identified in at least one intervention. The BCTs identified in almost all interventions were: instruction on how to perform the behavior, setting behavioural goals and action planning. The BCTs that occurred more frequently in effective interventions, were: practical social support, behavioural practice, self-monitoring of behaviour and credible source for example a skilled clinician delivering the intervention. The presence of identical BCTs in comparator groups may diminish effects.CONCLUSIONS: Swallowing interventions feature multiple components that may potentially impact outcomes. This review maps the behavioural components of reported interventions and provides a method to consistently describe these components going forward. Future work may seek to test the most effective BCTs, to inform optimisation of swallowing interventions.	NA	0
28068938	Acupuncture combined with methylcobalamin for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients with multiple myeloma.	BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) seriously affects the quality of life of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) as well as the response rate to chemotherapy. Acupuncture has a potential role in the treatment of CIPN, but at present there have been no randomized clinical research studies to analyze the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of CIPN, particularly in MM patients.METHODS: The MM patients (104 individuals) who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned into a solely methylcobalamin therapy group (500 μg intramuscular methylcobalamin injections every other day for 20 days; ten injections) followed by 2 months of 500 μg oral methylcobalamin administration, three times per day) and an acupuncture combined with methylcobalamin (Met + Acu) group (methylcobalamin used the same way as above accompanied by three cycles of acupuncture). Of the patients, 98 out of 104 completed the treatment and follow-ups. There were 49 patients in each group. The evaluating parameters included the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (Fact/GOG-Ntx) questionnaire scores, and electromyographic (EMG) nerve conduction velocity (NCV) determinations. We evaluated the changes of the parameters in each group before and after the therapies and made a comparison between the two groups.RESULTS: After 84 days (three cycles) of therapy, the pain was significantly alleviated in both groups, with a significantly higher decrease in the acupuncture treated group (P &lt; 0.01). The patients' daily activity evaluated by Fact/GOG-Ntx questionnaires significantly improved in the Met + Acu group (P &lt; 0.001). The NCV in the Met + Acu group improved significantly while amelioration in the control group was not observed.CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that acupuncture combined with methylcobalamin in the treatment of CIPN showed a better outcome than methylcobalamin administration alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: China Clinical Trials Register (registration no.

28068937	The efficacy and roles of combining temozolomide with whole brain radiotherapy in protection neurocognitive function and improvement quality of life of non-small-cell lung cancer patients with brain metastases.	BACKGROUND: Brain metastasis (BM) is a poor prognostic factor for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The efficacy and roles of combining temozolomide (TMZ) with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in protection neurocognitive function (NCF) and improvement quality of life (QOL) were investigated and compared with WBRT alone in the treatment of NSCLC patients with BM.METHODS: A total of 238 NSCLC patients with BM were reviewed and categorized into WBRT plus TMZ (RCT) arm and WBRT alone (RT), respectively. The efficacy was evaluated with Pearson chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model. NCF was assessed by using revised Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT-R), Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) test and Trail-making Test (TMT). QOL was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Lung (FACT-L) Chinese version 4.0 questionnaire.RESULTS: The average intracranial objective response (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) for all the patients were 26.9 and 95.8%, respectively. The intracranial ORR and DCR for RCT and RT arm were 34.9% vs. 20.2% (p = 0.01) and 98.4% vs. 92.7% (p = 0.03), respectively. The median intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of NSCLC patients with BM were 5.2 and 7.3 months, respectively. The median PFS of RCT arm was significantly longer than that of RT arm (5.9 vs. 4.9 months, p = 0.002). The median OS of the RCT arm was also slightly longer than that of the RT arm (8.5 vs. 5.9 months), but without statistical significance (p = 0.11). Multivariate analysis indicated that TMZ was a significant factor for PFS. Statistically significant differences on NCF and QOL were observed between CRT and RT arms at 5 months. RCT showed a trend of toxicities increase compared with RT, however, the toxicities were tolerable and manageable.CONCLUSIONS: Adding TMZ to WBRT in the treatment of NSCLC patients with BM could improve the intracranial ORR, DCR, and median PFS compared with WBRT alone. Although no remarkable difference on median OS was found, adding TMZ could prevent NCF and QOL from worsening. The side effects increased by adding TMZ, but the difference was not statistical significance and toxicities were well tolerated.	NA	0
28068936	Retrospective study of RAS/PIK3CA/BRAF tumor mutations as predictors of response to first-line chemotherapy with bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer patients.	BACKGROUND: After analysis of minor RAS mutations (KRAS exon 3, 4/NRAS) in the FIRE-3 and PRIME studies, an expanded range of RAS mutations were established as a negative predictive marker for the efficacy of anti-EGFR antibody treatment. BRAF and PIK3CA mutations may be candidate biomarkers for anti-EGFR targeted therapies. However, it remains unknown whether RAS/PIK3CA/BRAF tumor mutations can predict the efficacy of bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer. We assessed whether selection according to RAS/PIK3CA/BRAF mutational status could be beneficial for patients treated with bevacizumab as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.METHODS: Of the 1001 consecutive colorectal cancer patients examined for RAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF tumor mutations using a multiplex kit (Luminex®), we studied 90 patients who received combination chemotherapy with bevacizumab as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. The objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated according to mutational status.RESULTS: The ORR was higher among patients with wild-type tumors (64.3%) compared to those with tumors that were only wild type with respect to KRAS exon 2 (54.8%), and the differences in ORR between patients with wild-type and mutant-type tumors were greater when considering only KRAS exon 2 mutations (6.8%) rather than RAS/PIK3CA/BRAF mutations (18.4%). There were no statistically significant differences in ORR or PFS between all wild-type tumors and tumors carrying any of the mutations. Multivariate analysis revealed that liver metastasis and RAS and BRAF mutations were independent negative factors for disease progression after first-line treatment with bevacizumab.CONCLUSIONS: Patient selection according to RAS/PIK3CA/BRAF mutations could help select patients who will achieve a better response to bevacizumab treatment. We found no clinical benefit of restricting combination therapy with bevacizumab for metastatic colorectal cancer patients with EGFR-wild type tumors.	NA	1
28068934	Concordance between PIK3CA mutations in endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: PIK3CA mutations are expected to be potential therapeutic targets for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We aimed to clarify the concordance between PIK3CA mutations detected in endoscopic biopsy specimens and corresponding surgically resected specimens.METHODS: We examined five hotspot mutations in the PIK3CA gene (E542K, E545K, E546K, H1047R, and H1047L) in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections of paired endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens from 181 patients undergoing curative resection for ESCC between 2000 and 2011 using a Luminex technology-based multiplex gene mutation detection kit.RESULTS: Mutation analyses were successfully performed for both endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens in all the cases. A PIK3CA mutation was detected in either type of specimen in 13 cases (7.2%, 95% confidence interval: 3.9-12.0). The overall concordance rate, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 98.3% (178/181), 90.9% (10/11), and 98.8% (168/170), respectively. Among patients with a PIK3CA mutation detected in both types of specimens, the concordance between PIK3CA mutation genotypes was 100%. There were three cases with a discordant mutation status between the types of specimens (PIK3CA mutation in surgically resected specimen and wild-type in biopsy specimen in two cases, and the opposite pattern in one case), suggesting possible intratumoral heterogeneity in the PIK3CA mutation status.CONCLUSIONS: The PIK3CA mutation status was highly concordant between endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens from the same patient, suggesting that endoscopic biopsy specimens can be clinically used to detect PIK3CA mutations in patients with ESCC.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the performance characteristics of 3 risk-stratification models, referred to as Mayo, Helsinki and Milwaukee models, in predicting lymphatic dissemination in endometrial cancer.METHODS: A total of 1052 patients with stage I-III endometrioid endometrial cancer were included in the study. The areas under curve were compared with the receiver operating characteristic curve area comparison test. Chi-square and Fisher exact test were used for comparing categorical variables. The Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox regression models were used for survival analyses. The median follow-up time was 55months (range 1-108).RESULTS: Areas under curve were 0.781, 0.830 and 0.829 for the Mayo, Helsinki (P=0.285 vs. Mayo) and Milwaukee (P=0.292 vs. Mayo) models, respectively, in predicting lymphatic dissemination. The rates of false negatives and false positives were similar for all models. The lymphadenectomy rate decreased in the order of Mayo model (71.5%)&gt;Helsinki model (62.4%)&gt;Milwaukee model (48.8%). In patients with stage I cancer, disease specific survival was better for those who satisfied low-risk criteria according to any of the models. In patients with stage II-III cancer, this difference in survival was significant only for the Milwaukee model. Both lymphatic dissemination and high-risk tumor features as per the risk models were independent predictors of survival.CONCLUSIONS: The studied models had a similar accuracy in predicting lymphatic dissemination in endometrial cancer. Lymphadenectomy rate was lowest for the Milwaukee model. Survival analyses suggest that variables included in the models predict patient outcome independently of tumor stage.	NA	0
28069000	Long non-coding RNA TUG1 is involved in cell growth and chemoresistance of small cell lung cancer by regulating LIMK2b via EZH2.	BACKGROUND: Taurine upregulated gene1 (TUG1) as a 7.1-kb lncRNA, has been shown to play an oncogenic role in various cancers. However, the biological functions of lncRNA TUG1 in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remain unknown. The aim of this study is to explore the roles of TUG1 in cell growth and chemoresistance of SCLC and its possible molecular mechanism.METHODS: The expression of TUG1 in thirty-three cases of SCLC tissues and SCLC cell line were examined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The functional roles of TUG1 in SCLC were demonstrated by CCK8 assay, colony formation assay, wound healing assay and transwell assay, flow cytometry analysis and in vivo study through siRNA or shRNA mediated knockdown. Western blot assays were used to evaluate gene and protein expression in cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) were performed to confirm the molecular mechanism of TUG1 involved in cell growth and chemoresistance of small cell lung cancer.RESULTS: We found that TUG1 was overexpressed in SCLC tissues, and its expression was correlated with the clinical stage and the shorter survival time of SCLC patients. Moreover, downregulation of TUG1 expression could impair cell proliferation and increased cell sensitivity to anticancer drugs both in vitro and in vivo. We also discovered that TUG1 knockdown significantly promoted cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and inhibited cell migration and invasion in vitro . We further demonstrated that TUG1 can regulate the expression of LIMK2b (a splice variant of LIM-kinase 2) via binding with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and then promoted cell growth and chemoresistance of SCLC.CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results suggested that TUG1 mediates cell growth and chemoresistance of SCLC by regulating LIMK2b via EZH2.

28070729	Inhibiting autophagy with chloroquine enhances the anti-tumor effect of high-LET carbon ions via ER stress-related apoptosis.	Energetic carbon ions (CI) offer great advantages over conventional radiations such as X- or γ-rays in cancer radiotherapy. High linear energy transfer (LET) CI can induce both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy in tumor cells under certain circumstances. The molecular connection between ER stress and autophagy in tumor exposed to high-LET radiation and how these two pathways influence the therapeutic effect against tumor remain poorly understood. In this work, we studied the impact of autophagy and apoptosis induced by ER stress following high-LET CI radiation on the radiosensitivity of S180 cells both in vitro and in vivo. In the in vitro experiment, X-rays were also used as a reference radiation. Our results documented that the combination of CI radiation with chloroquine (CQ), a special autophagy inhibitor, produced more pronounced proliferation suppression in S180 cells and xenograft tumors. Co-treatment with CI radiation and CQ could block autophagy through the IRE1/JNK/Beclin-1 axis and enhance apoptotic cell death via the activation of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) by the IRE1 pathway rather than PERK in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our study indicates that inhibiting autophagy might be a promising therapeutic strategy in CI radiotherapy via aggravating the ER stress-related apoptosis.	NA	0
28070767	Strut-adjusted volume implant (SAVI) brachytherapy-based accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in African American women.	PURPOSE: To examine the clinical outcomes of postmenopausal African American (AA) women treated with strut-adjusted volume implant brachytherapy-based accelerated partial breast irradiation for early-stage node-negative breast cancer.METHODS: From January 2011 through April 2015, a total of 50 AA patients, meeting criteria to receive APBI as defined by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-39 (NASBP B-39), completed treatment with the SAVI breast brachytherapy device at Howard University Hospital.RESULTS: 4% ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence and 2% breast cancer-specific mortality was observed. Median follow-up has been 3.8 years with a range of 0.29-4.69 years. Dosimetry parameters yielded a median V90 of 96.22% (range 77.86-105.00%), a median V150 of 31.27 cm(3) (range 23.30-49.15 mL), and a median V200 of 14.53 cm(3) (range 5.92-19.38 mL). Cosmesis was excellent. There were no infections, persistent seromas, fat necrosis, or telangiectasias observed to date.CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first study to describe the use of SAVI as APBI in an exclusively AA population. This study has demonstrated excellent local control in appropriately selected patients, similar clinical outcomes to the general population, and good to excellent cosmesis in AA women to date.	NA	0
28069289	Liquid Biopsy Analysis of FGFR3 and PIK3CA Hotspot Mutations for Disease Surveillance in Bladder Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Disease surveillance in patients with bladder cancer is important for early diagnosis of progression and metastasis and for optimised treatment.OBJECTIVE: To develop urine and plasma assays for disease surveillance for patients with FGFR3 and PIK3CA tumour mutations.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) assays were developed and tumour DNA from two patient cohorts was screened for FGFR3 and PIK3CA hotspot mutations. One cohort included 363 patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). The other cohort included 468 patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy (Cx). Urine supernatants (NMIBC n=216, Cx n=27) and plasma samples (NMIBC n=39, Cx n=27) from patients harbouring mutations were subsequently screened using ddPCR assays.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Progression-free survival, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival were measured. Fisher's exact test, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Cox regression analysis were applied.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In total, 36% of the NMIBC patients (129/363) and 11% of the Cx patients (44/403) harboured at least one FGFR3 or PIK3CA mutation. Screening of DNA from serial urine supernatants from the NMIBC cohort revealed that high levels of tumour DNA (tDNA) were associated with later disease progression in NMIBC (p=0.003). Furthermore, high levels of tDNA in plasma samples were associated with recurrence in the Cx cohort (p=0.016). A positive correlation between tDNA levels in urine and plasma was observed (correlation coefficient 0.6). The retrospective study design and low volumes of plasma available for analysis were limitations of the study.CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutated DNA in urine and plasma are indicative of later progression and metastasis in bladder cancer.PATIENT SUMMARY: Urine and plasma from patients with bladder cancer may be monitored for diagnosis of progression and metastasis using mutation assays.

28071763	Starved epithelial cells uptake extracellular matrix for survival.	Extracellular matrix adhesion is required for normal epithelial cell survival, nutrient uptake and metabolism. This requirement can be overcome by oncogene activation. Interestingly, inhibition of PI3K/mTOR leads to apoptosis of matrix-detached, but not matrix-attached cancer cells, suggesting that matrix-attached cells use alternate mechanisms to maintain nutrient supplies. Here we demonstrate that under conditions of dietary restriction or growth factor starvation, where PI3K/mTOR signalling is decreased, matrix-attached human mammary epithelial cells upregulate and internalize β4-integrin along with its matrix substrate, laminin. Endocytosed laminin localizes to lysosomes, results in increased intracellular levels of essential amino acids and enhanced mTORC1 signalling, preventing cell death. Moreover, we show that starved human fibroblasts secrete matrix proteins that maintain the growth of starved mammary epithelial cells contingent upon epithelial cell β4-integrin expression. Our study identifies a crosstalk between stromal fibroblasts and epithelial cells under starvation that could be exploited therapeutically to target tumours resistant to PI3K/mTOR inhibition.	NA	0
28070726	Prognostic and Oncologic Significance of Perineural Invasion in Sporadic Colorectal Cancer.	BACKGROUND: The presence of perineural invasion (PNI) in colorectal cancer (CRC) indicates a more aggressive phenotype, resulting in a poor prognosis. The aims of this study were to evaluate the oncologic outcome of PNI+ tumors and to investigate whether PNI status affects patient survival.METHODS: The study retrospectively enrolled 3807 patients from a single institution who underwent surgery for colorectal adenocarcinoma between January 2006 and December 2010. The patients were classified into two groups based on PNI status: PNI+ and PNI-.RESULTS: The PNI+ group included 565 patients (14.8 %) and had significantly more involved circumferential resection margins (p = 0.001) and a more advanced TNM stage (p = 0.001) than the PNI- group. Compared with the PNI- group, the PNI+ group had worse 5-year overall survival (65 vs. 88 %; p = 0.001) and 5-year disease-free survival (63 vs. 85 %; p = 0.001). Among PNI+ patients with stage IIA disease, those who received adjuvant therapy had significantly greater 5-year overall survival than those who did not (89.3 vs. 50.8 %; p = 0.001). In multivariate analyses, PNI+ was an independent negative prognostic factor for 5-year overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.518, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.175-1.961; p = 0.001) and 5-year disease-free survival (HR 1.495, 95 % CI 1.237-1.806; p = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: PNI positivity is an independent predictor of aggressive behavior and unfavorable prognosis in CRC. Further evaluation is needed to confirm the impact of PNI status on survival in stage IIA CRC.	NA	0
28070725	Type of Resection (Whipple vs. Distal) Does Not Affect the National Failure to Provide Post-resection Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Localized Pancreatic Cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival after curative intent resection for localized pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Given the differences in perioperative morbidity, we hypothesized that patients undergoing distal partial pancreatectomy (DPP) would receive adjuvant therapy more often those undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy (PD).METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base (2004-2012) identified patients with localized PDAC undergoing DPP and PD, excluding neoadjuvant cases, and factors associated with receipt of adjuvant therapy were identified. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.RESULTS: Overall, 13,501 patients were included (DPP, n = 1933; PD, n = 11,568). Prognostic characteristics were similar, except DPP patients had fewer N1 lesions, less often positive margins, more minimally invasive resections, and shorter hospital stay. The proportion of patients not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy was equivalent (DPP 33.7%, PD 32.0%; p = 0.148). The type of procedure was not independently associated with adjuvant chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.90-1.02; p = 0.150), and patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy had improved unadjusted and adjusted OS compared with surgery alone. The type of resection did not predict adjusted mortality (p = 0.870).CONCLUSION: Receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy did not vary by type of resection but improved survival independent of procedure performed. Factors other than type of resection appear to be driving the nationwide rates of post-resection adjuvant chemotherapy in localized PDAC.	NA	0
28072477	Recurrent NAB2-STAT6 gene fusions and estrogen receptor alpha expression in pulmonary adenofibromas.	AIMS: Pulmonary adenofibromas are rare benign fibroepithelial tumours of the lung with unknown histogenesis and an indolent clinical behaviour. Their stroma resembles that of solitary fibrous tumours, while the glands are composed of respiratory epithelium organized in a phyllodes-like architecture. Differentiation of pulmonary adenofibromas from other more aggressive intrathoracic tumours is clinically relevant. However, their biology is unknown. Here, we sought to characterize pulmonary adenofibromas at a clinicopathologic level and to define whether they could be underpinned by a highly recurrent somatic genetic alteration akin to tumours with similar morphology.METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven pulmonary adenofibromas were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for TTF1, napsin A, CK7, E-cadherin, CD99, CD34, CD31, STAT6, ER, PR, AR, Bcl2, and vimentin, as well as electron microscopy and capillary sequencing on microdissected samples to evaluate the presence of NAB2-STAT6 fusion genes and MED12 exon 2 mutations in their discrete components. A control group comprising pulmonary solitary fibrous tumours, pulmonary hamartomas, and breast fibroadenomas was also analysed. We confirmed that the stromal elements of pulmonary adenofibromas pertain to the fibroblastic lineage and display ER overexpression in 71% of cases, while the epithelium consists of TTF1-positive, E-cadherin positive bronchiolar elements. A highly recurrent NAB2-STAT6 fusion variant (exon 4-exon 2) was detected in the stroma but not in the epithelium. No MED12 mutations were identified.CONCLUSIONS: Here, we demonstrate that pulmonary adenofibromas are neoplastic lesions harbouring the molecular hallmark of solitary fibrous tumours.

28070921	BRM/SMARCA2-negative clear cell renal cell carcinoma is associated with a high percentage of BRM somatic mutations, deletions and promoter methylation.	AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate potential molecular mechanisms associated with loss of BRM expression in poorly differentiated clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen previously selected BRM-negative RCC tissues were examined by DNA sequencing, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the BRM gene. BRM mutation was identified in 78.9% (15 of 19) cases, chromosome 9 monosomy or BRM deletion in 43.8% (seven of 16) and BRM promoter region cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) methylation in 42.8% (six of 14). These results indicated that 89.5% (17 of 19) of the cases harboured at least one type of BRM genetic alteration, with two or more types of alteration in 47.4% (nine of 19). Such alterations were found rarely in adjacent non-neoplastic tissues and low-grade areas of composite tumours.CONCLUSIONS: BRM gene mutation, chromosome 9 monosomy or BRM deletion and CpG methylation contribute collectively to the loss of BRM expression in ccRCC. This work focusing on composite tumours indicated that BRM abnormality occurred during tumour progression.	NA	2
28071724	Osteoclastic miR-214 targets TRAF3 to contribute to osteolytic bone metastasis of breast cancer.	The role of osteoclastic miRNAs in regulating osteolytic bone metastasis (OBM) of breast cancer is still underexplored. Here, we examined the expression profiles of osteoclastogenic miRNAs in human bone specimens and identified that miR-214-3p was significantly upregulated in breast cancer patients with OBM. Consistently, we found increased miR-214-3p within osteoclasts, which was associated with the elevated bone resorption, during the development of OBM in human breast cancer xenografted nude mice (BCX). Furthermore, genetic ablation of osteoclastic miR-214-3p in nude mice prevent the development of OBM. Conditioned medium from MDA-MB-231 cells dramatically stimulated miR-214-3p expression to promote osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, a series of in vitro study showed that miR-214-3p directly targeted Traf3 to promote osteoclast activity and bone-resorbing activity. In addition, osteoclast-specific miR-214-3p knock-in mice showed remarkably increased bone resorption when compared to the littermate controls, which was attenuated after osteoclast-targeted treatment with Traf3 3'UTR-containing plasmid. In BCX nude mice, osteoclast-targeted antagomir-214-3p delivery could recover the TRAF3 protein expression and attenuate the development of OBM, respectively. Collectively, inhibition of osteoclastic miR-214-3p may be a potential therapeutic strategy for breast cancer patients with OBM. Meanwhile, the intraosseous TRAF3 could be a promising biomarker for evaluation of the treatment response of antagomir-214-3p.	NA	2
28071680	Loss of tricellular tight junction protein LSR promotes cell invasion and migration via upregulation of TEAD1/AREG in human endometrial cancer.	Lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) is a unique molecule of tricellular contacts of normal and cancer cells. We investigated how the loss of LSR induced cell migration, invasion and proliferation in endometrial cancer cell line Sawano. mRNAs of amphiregulin (AREG) and TEA domain family member 1 (TEAD1) were markedly upregulated by siRNA-LSR. In endometrial cancer tissues, downregulation of LSR and upregulation of AREG were observed together with malignancy, and Yes-associated protein (YAP) was present in the nuclei. siRNA-AREG prevented the cell migration and invasion induced by siRNA-LSR, whereas treatment with AREG induced cell migration and invasion. LSR was colocalized with TRIC, angiomotin (AMOT), Merlin and phosphorylated YAP (pYAP). siRNA-LSR increased expression of pYAP and decreased that of AMOT and Merlin. siRNA-YAP prevented expression of the mRNAs of AREG and TEAD1, and the cell migration and invasion induced by siRNA-LSR. Treatment with dobutamine and 2-deoxy-D-glucose and glucose starvation induced the pYAP expression and prevented the cell migration and invasion induced by siRNA-LSR. siRNA-AMOT decreased the Merlin expression and prevented the cell migration and invasion induced by siRNA-LSR. The loss of LSR promoted cell invasion and migration via upregulation of TEAD1/AREG dependent on YAP/pYAP and AMOT/Merlin in human endometrial cancer cells.	NA	2
28071670	Benzyl Isothiocyanate potentiates p53 signaling and antitumor effects against breast cancer through activation of p53-LKB1 and p73-LKB1 axes.	Functional reactivation of p53 pathway, although arduous, can potentially provide a broad-based strategy for cancer therapy owing to frequent p53 inactivation in human cancer. Using a phosphoprotein-screening array, we found that Benzyl Isothiocynate, (BITC) increases p53 phosphorylation in breast cancer cells and reveal an important role of ERK and PRAS40/MDM2 in BITC-mediated p53 activation. We show that BITC rescues and activates p53-signaling network and inhibits growth of p53-mutant cells. Mechanistically, BITC induces p73 expression in p53-mutant cells, disrupts the interaction of p73 and mutant-p53, thereby releasing p73 from sequestration and allowing it to be transcriptionally active. Furthermore, BITC-induced p53 and p73 axes converge on tumor-suppressor LKB1 which is transcriptionally upregulated by p53 and p73 in p53-wild-type and p53-mutant cells respectively; and in a feed-forward mechanism, LKB1 tethers with p53 and p73 to get recruited to p53-responsive promoters. Analyses of BITC-treated xenografts using LKB1-null cells corroborate in vitro mechanistic findings and establish LKB1 as the key node whereby BITC potentiates as well as rescues p53-pathway in p53-wild-type as well as p53-mutant cells. These data provide first in vitro and in vivo evidence of the integral role of previously unrecognized crosstalk between BITC, p53/LKB1 and p73/LKB1 axes in breast tumor growth-inhibition.	therapeutic	1
28069384	Regulation of cancerous progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by miR-34c-3p via modulation of MAP3K2 signaling in triple-negative breast cancer cells.	Emerging but limited data have evidenced an essential involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the development and progression of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which empowers these small regulators as an innovative therapeutic approach, especially for this unique tumor subgroup still lacking an efficient and specific therapeutic target. Herein, we reported the down-regulation of miR-34c-3p level in TNBC tissues, and its expression was closely associated with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), but not other receptors, in well-characterized breast cancer (BCa) cells. Functionally, ectopic expression of miR-34c-3p inhibited migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in TNBC cells. From a mechanistic standpoint, bioinformatics coupled with luciferase and gain-of-function, loss-of-function assays showed that miR-34c-3p may regulate TNBC progression by directly targeting the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2 (MAP3K2). Consistently, MAP3K2 overexpression could effectively rescue miR-34c-3p mimics-induced suppression of cell invasion and EMT. In light of these findings, miR-34c-3p may function as a tumor suppressor in regulating of TNBC invasiveness and EMT through negatively modulating MAP3K2 pathway. Future endeavor in this field may help to identify a novel biomarker to predict prognosis and response to therapy in TNBC.	NA	2
28069382	Antibiotic tigecycline enhances cisplatin activity against human hepatocellular carcinoma through inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage.	Targeting mitochondrial metabolism has been recently demonstrated to be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of various cancer. In this work, we demonstrate that antibiotic tigecycline is selectively against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage. Tigecycline is more effective in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of HCC than normal liver cells. Importantly, tigecycline significantly enhances the inhibitory effects of chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin in HCC in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, tigecycline specifically inhibits mitochondrial translation as shown by the decreased protein levels of Cox-1 and -2 but not Cox-4 or Grp78, and increased mRNA levels of Cox-1 and -2 but not Cox-4 in HCC cells exposed to tigecycline. In addition, tigecycline significantly induces mitochondrial dysfunction in HCC cells via decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential, complex I and IV activities, mitochondrial respiration and ATP levels. Tigecycline also increases levels of mitochondrial superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and ROS levels. Consistent with oxidative stress, oxidative damage on DNA, protein and lipid are also observed in tigecycline-treated cells. Importantly, antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) reverses the effects of tigecycline, suggesting that oxidative stress is required for the action of tigecycline in HCC cells. We further show that HCC cells have higher level of mitochondrial biogenesis than normal liver cells which might explain the different sensitivity to tigecycline between HCC and normal liver cells. Our work is the first to demonstrate that tigecycline is a promising candidate for HCC treatment and highlight the therapeutic value of targeting mitochondrial metabolism in HCC.	NA	0
28069380	microRNA-495 promotes bladder cancer cell growth and invasion by targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog.	Accumulating evidence has linked deregulation of microRNA-495 (miR-495) to tumorigenesis; however, its function in tumor progression is controversial. This work was undertaken to explore the expression and biological roles of miR-495 in bladder cancer. The expression of miR-495 was examined in 67 pairs of bladder cancer and adjacent normal bladder tissues. The roles of miR-495 in bladder cancer cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo were determined. Direct target gene(s) mediating the activity of miR-495 in bladder cancer cells was identified. It was found that miR-495 was expressed at greater levels in bladder tissues and cell lines. High expression of miR-495 was significantly associated with larger tumor size, advanced TNM stage, and lymph node metastasis. Overexpression of miR-495 significantly promoted bladder cancer cell proliferation and invasion, whereas inhibition of miR-495 suppressed cell proliferation and invasion. PTEN, a well-defined tumor suppressor was identified to be a target gene of miR-495. A significant inverse correlation between miR-495 and PTEN expression was noted in bladder cancer tissues (r = -0.3094, P = 0.0125). Overexpression of miR-495 led to reduction of PTEN expression in bladder cancer cells. Rescue experiments showed that enforced expression of PTEN impaired miR-495-mediated bladder cancer proliferation and invasion. In vivo mouse studies demonstrated that overexpression of miR-495 accelerated the growth of subcutaneous bladder cancer xenografts, which was associated with downregulation of PTEN. Overall, these findings indicate that miR-495 upregulation contributes to bladder cancer cell growth, invasion, and tumorigenesis by targeting PTEN and offer a potential therapeutic target for bladder cancer.

28069379	NDRG2 overexpression suppresses hepatoma cells survival during metabolic stress through disturbing the activation of fatty acid oxidation.	Because of the high nutrient consumption and inadequate vascularization, solid tumor constantly undergoes metabolic stress during tumor development. Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes participated in cancer cells' metabolic reprogramming. N-Myc downstream regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) is a recently identified tumor suppressor gene, but its function in cancer metabolism, particularly during metabolic stress, remains unclear. In this study, we found that NDRG2 overexpression significantly reduced hepatoma cell proliferation and enhanced cell apoptosis under glucose limitation. Moreover, NDRG2 overexpression aggravated energy imbalance and oxidative stress by decreasing the intracellular ATP and NADPH generation and increasing ROS levels. Strikingly, NDRG2 inhibited the activation of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), which preserves ATP and NADPH purveyance in the absence of glucose. Finally, mechanistic investigation showed that NDRG2 overexpression suppressed the glucose-deprivation induced AMPK/ACC pathway activation in hepatoma cells, whereas the expression of a constitutively active form of AMPK abrogated glucose-deprivation induced AMPK activation and cell apoptosis. Thus, as a negative regulator of AMPK, NDRG2 disturbs the induction of FAO genes by glucose limitation, leading to dysregulation of ATP and NADPH, and thus reduces the tolerance of hepatoma cells to glucose limitation.

28070990	A targeted next-generation sequencing in the molecular risk stratification of adult acute myeloid leukemia: implications for clinical practice.	Conventional cytogenetics can categorize patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) into favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable-risk groups; however, patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics represent the major population with variable outcomes. Because molecular profiling can assist with AML prognosis and next-generation sequencing allows simultaneous sequencing of many target genes, we analyzed 260 genes in 112 patients with de novo AML who received standard treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that karyotypes and mutation status of TET2, PHF6, KIT, and NPM1(mutation) /FLT3- internal tandem duplication (ITD)(negative) were independent prognostic factors for the entire cohort. Among patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, patients with mutations in CEBPA(double mutation) , IDH2, and NPM1 in the absence of FLT3-ITD were associated with improved Overall survival (OS), similar to those with favorable-risk cytogenetics; patients with mutations in TET2, RUNX1, ASXL1, and DNMT3A were associated with reduced OS, similar to those with unfavorable-risk cytogenetics. We concluded that integration of cytogenetic and molecular profiling improves prognostic stratification of patients into three groups with more distinct prognoses (P &lt; 0.001) and significantly reduces the number of patients classified as intermediate risk. In addition, our study demonstrates that next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based multi-gene sequencing is clinically applicable in establishing an accurate risk stratification system for guiding therapeutic decisions.

28070935	Alendronate-anchored PEGylation of ceria nanoparticles promotes human hepatoma cell proliferation via AKT/ERK signaling pathways.	Previous work has suggested that ceria nanoparticles (CNPs) have regenerative antioxidant properties, which have motivated researchers to consider CNPs as therapeutic agents for treating a number of diseases, including cancer. Recent studies have shown CNPs to be toxic to cancer cells, to inhibit invasion and sensitize cancer cells to radiotherapy. In addition, several hydrophilic polymers have been used to coat the CNP surface in order to enhance its properties of extensive biocompatibility and systemic nontoxicity to normal cells and tissues. However, the results of previous studies were based on high CNP doses (10 μg/mL or more), and these doses may cause serious side effects in clinical applications. The impact of low CNP doses on tumor cells remains unknown. In this study, we report experiments indicating that CNPs-AL- polyethylene glycol (PEG)600, a type of surface-modified CNP that is more stable and less toxic than traditional CNPs could promote proliferation of hepatoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, further research showed that a low dose (0.01 μg/mL) of CNPs-AL-PEG600 could reduce hepatoma cell apoptosis and activate AKT/ERK signaling pathways. These results may provide information that is important for using CNPs-AL-PEG600 as a therapeutic agent in clinical cancer treatments.	NA	0
28069693	DNA Fragile Site Breakage as a Measure of Chemical Exposure and Predictor of Individual Susceptibility to Form Oncogenic Rearrangements.	Chromosomal rearrangements induced by non-radiation causes contribute to the majority of oncogenic fusions found in cancer. Treatment of human thyroid cells with fragile site-inducing laboratory chemicals can cause preferential DNA breakage at the RET gene and generate the RET/PTC1 rearrangement, a common driver mutation in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). Here, we demonstrate that treatment with non-cytotoxic levels of environmental chemicals (benzene and diethylnitrosamine) or chemotherapeutic agents (etoposide and doxorubicin) generates significant DNA breakage within RET at levels similar to those generated by fragile site-inducing laboratory chemicals. This suggests that chronic exposure to these chemicals plays a role in the formation of non-radiation associated RET/PTC rearrangements. We also investigated whether the sensitivity of the fragile RET region could predict the likelihood of rearrangement formation using normal thyroid tissues from patients with and without RET/PTC rearrangements. We found that normal cells of patients with thyroid cancer driven by RET/PTC rearrangements have significantly higher blunt-ended, double-stranded DNA breaks at RET than those of patients without RET/PTC rearrangements. This sensitivity of a cancer driver gene suggests for the first time that a DNA breakage test at the RET region could be utilized to evaluate susceptibility to RET/PTC formation. Further, the significant increase of blunt-ended, double-stranded DNA breaks, but not other types of DNA breaks, in normal cells from patients with RET/PTC-driven tumors suggests that blunt-ended double-stranded DNA breaks are a preferred substrate for rearrangement formation, and implicate involvement of the non-homologous end joining pathway in the formation of RET/PTC rearrangements.

28069692	Genes involved in development and differentiation are commonly methylated in cancers derived from multiple organs: A single-institutional methylome analysis using 1007 tissue specimens.	The aim of this study was to clarify the significance of DNA methylation alterations shared by cancers derived from multiple organs. We analyzed single-institutional methylome data by single-CpG-resolution Infinium assay for 1,007 samples of non-cancerous tissue (N) and corresponding cancerous tissue (T) obtained from lung, stomach, kidney, breast and liver. Principal component analysis revealed that N samples of each organ showed distinct DNA methylation profiles, DNA methylation profiles of N samples of each organ being inherited by the corresponding T samples and DNA methylation profiles of T samples being more similar to those of N samples in the same organ than those of T samples in other organs. In contrast to such organ and/or carcinogenetic factor-specificity of DNA methylation profiles, when compared to the corresponding N samples, 231 genes commonly showed DNA hypermethylation in T samples in four or more organs. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that such commonly methylated genes were enriched among &quot;transcriptional factors&quot; participating in development and/or differentiation, which reportedly show bivalent histone modification in embryonic stem cells. Pyrosequencing and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR revealed an inverse correlation between DNA methylation levels and mRNA expression levels of representative commonly methylated genes, such as ALX1, ATP8A2, CR1 and EFCAB1, in tissue samples. These data suggest that disruption of the differentiated state of precancerous cells via alterations of expression, independent of differences in organs and/or carcinogenetic factors, may be a common feature of DNA methylation alterations during carcinogenesis in multiple organs.

28070642	Distinct expression profile of stem cell markers, LGR5 and LGR6, in basaloid skin tumors.	Mammalian epidermis, which is composed of hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and interfollicular epidermis, is maintained by discrete stem cells. In vivo lineage tracing demonstrated that murine LGR5 cells are mainly responsible for hair follicle regeneration whereas LGR6 cells generate sebaceous glands and interfollicular epidermis. However, little is known about their expression in the human skin tumors. In this study, we investigated the expression profile of LGR5 and LGR6 in a variety of human skin tumors including basaloid tumors with follicular differentiation (94 basal cell carcinomas, 18 trichoepitheliomas, 3 basaloid follicular hamartomas, and 12 pilomatricomas) and tumors with ductal differentiation (7 eccrine poromas, 8 hidradenomas, and 5 spiradenomas). LGR5 expression was highest in basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) followed by trichoepitheliomas (TEs) and basaloid follicular hamartomas. LGR6 had the same expression pattern as LGR5, even though its expression was lower. Interestingly, LGR6 expression was detected in stromal cells around the tumor and papillary mesenchymal bodies of TEs but not in stromal cells of BCCs, suggesting different characteristics of tumor-associated fibroblasts between TEs and BCCs. It was unexpected to find that pilomatricomas exclusively expressed LGR6, and its expression was limited to the basaloid cells. Notably, LGR6-positive cells were observed in sweat gland ductal cells in normal skin. This might explain, in part, the finding that LGR6 expression was relatively higher in basaloid tumors with ductal differentiation than in those with follicular differentiation. In particular, spiradenomas displayed the same distribution pattern of LGR6 as normal sweat glands, suggesting the possibility of LGR6-positive cells as tumor stem cells. In conclusion, we documented the different expression patterns of stem cell markers, LGR5 and LGR6 in various skin tumors. These data may provide important insights to understand the origin and development of basaloid skin tumors.	NA	2
28070766	Radiofrequency ablation combined with transarterial chemoembolization versus hepatectomy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma within Milan criteria: a retrospective case-control study.	PROPOSAL: To compare the effectiveness of TACE + RFA with hepatectomy in patients with HCC within Milan criteria.METHODS: It is a retrospective matched case-control study from January 2006 to December 2010 in a tertiary cancer center. 74 patients with HCC within Milan criteria initially treated with TACE + RFA were identified and compared with 148 matched controls selected from a pool of 782 patients who received hepatectomy. Patients were matched with respect to age, gender, tumor size and number, AFP and liver function test.RESULTS: The 1, 3, and 5 years overall survival (OS) was 94.6, 75.1 and 55.3%, respectively, in the combination group, and 91.2, 64.4, and 47.7%, respectively, in the hepatectomy group (P = 0.488). The 1, 3, and 5 years disease-free survival (DFS) in the combination group was 87.8, 48.3, and 33.5%, respectively, and 68.9, 49.2, and 40.9%, respectively, in the hepatectomy group (P = 0.619). In subgroups analyses according to the tumor size and number, no significant difference was identified in either OS or DFS for patients with single tumor smaller than 3.0 cm, 3.0-5.0 cm, and multiple tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor size, ALT, and CLIP score were significant prognostic factors for OS, and ALT and Child-Pugh class were significant prognostic factors for DFS.CONCLUSION: TACE + RFA is safe and as effective as hepatectomy for patients with HCC within Milan criteria.

28069043	FGF19/FGFR4 signaling contributes to the resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma to sorafenib.	BACKGROUND: Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, is used as a standard therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, complete remission has not been achieved and the molecular basis of HCC resistance to sorafenib remains largely unknown. Previous studies have shown that fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) expression correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis of HCC. Here, we demonstrate the novel role of FGF19 in HCC resistance to sorafenib therapy.METHODS: FGF19 Knockdown cells were achieved by lentiviral-mediated interference, and FGFR4 knockout cells were achieved by CRISPR-Cas9. Protein levels of FGF19, FGFR4 and c-PARP in various HCC cell lines were measured by Western blotting analysis. Cell viability was determined by MTS assay, apoptosis was determined by DAPI nuclear staining and Western blot of c-PRAP, and ROS generation was determined by DCFH-DA staining and electrochemical biosensor.RESULTS: We showed that FGF19, when overexpressed, inhibited the effect of sorafenib on ROS generation and apoptosis in HCC. In contrast, loss of FGF19 or its receptor FGFR4 led to a remarkable increase in sorafenib-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. In addition, knockdown of FGF19 in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells significantly enhanced the sensitivity to sorafenib. Importantly, targeting FGF19/FGFR4 axis by ponatinib, a third-generation inhibitor of chronic myeloid leukemia, overcomes HCC resistance of sorafenib by enhancing ROS-associated apoptosis in sorafenib-treated HCC.CONCLUSION: Our results provide the first evidence that inhibition of FGF19/FGFR4 signaling significantly overcomes sorafenib resistance in HCC. Co-treatment of ponatinib and sorafinib may represent an effective therapeutic approach for eradicating HCC.	therapeutic	1

28069038	Motility of glioblastoma cells is driven by netrin-1 induced gain of stemness.	BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is an untreatable brain cancer. The tumors contain a population of stem-like cells which are highly invasive and resistant to therapies. These cells are the main reason for the lethality of glioblastoma. Extracellular guidance molecule netrin-1 promotes the invasiveness and survival of various cancer cell types. We have previously found that netrin-1 activates Notch signaling, and Notch signaling associates with cell stemness. Therefore, we have here investigated the effects of netrin-1 on glioblastoma pathogenesis and glioblastoma cell stemness.METHODS: Glioma tissue microarrays were stained with immunohistochemistry and the results were used to evaluate the association between netrin-1 and survival of glioma patients. The localization of netrin-1 was analyzed utilizing fresh frozen glioblastoma tissues. The glioma cell invasion was investigated using ex vivo glioma tissue cultures and newly established primary cell cultures in 3D in vitro invasion assays. Intracranial mouse xenograft models were utilized to investigate the effects of netrin-1 on glioblastoma growth and invasion in vivo.RESULTS: Netrin-1 expression associated with poor patient prognosis in grade II-III gliomas. In addition, its expression correlated with the stem-like cell marker nestin. Netrin-1 overexpression in cultured cells led to increased formation of stem-like cell spheroids. In glioblastoma tumor biopsies netrin-1 localized to hypoxic tumor areas known to be rich in the stem-like cells. In xenograft mouse models netrin-1 expression altered the phenotype of non-invasive glioblastoma cells into diffusively invading and increased the expression of glioma stem-like cell markers. Furthermore, a distinct invasion pattern where netrin-1 positive cells were following the invasive stem-like cells was detected both in mouse models and ex vivo human glioblastoma tissue cultures. Inhibition of netrin-1 signaling targeted especially the stem-like cells and inhibited their infiltrative growth.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings describe netrin-1 as an important regulator of glioblastoma cell stemness and motility. Netrin-1 activates Notch signaling in glioblastoma cells resulting in subsequent gain of stemness and enhanced invasiveness of these cells. Moreover, inhibition of netrin-1 signaling may offer a way to target stem-like cells.	NA	2
28069035	Fbw7 regulates apoptosis in activated B-cell like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by targeting Stat3 for ubiquitylation and degradation.	BACKGROUND: The ubiquitin-ligase Fbw7 acts as a tumor suppressor, targeting lots of proto-oncogenes for proteolysis. However, the exact role of Fbw7 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) development remains unclear.METHODS: We evaluated Fbw7 expression in patient samples of DLBCL using immunohistochemical staining. The effect of Fbw7 overexpression on cell viability and apoptosis was investigated using activated B-cell (ABC) like DLBCL cell lines. The mechanism of Fbw7 activity in DLBCL was investigated using immunoprecipitation, ubiquitination, western blot and qualitative analyses.RESULTS: The non-germinal center B-cell-like subtype of DLBCL showed reduced Fbw7 expression compared with the germinal center B-cell (GBC) subtype, and low Fbw7 expression was associated with a worse prognosis. Fbw7 overexpression caused decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis rates in the ABC-DLBCL cell lines SU-DHL-2 and OCI-LY-3. Importantly, Stat3 and phospho-Stat3(Tyr705) stability were reduced following Fbw7 overexpression in ABC-DLBCL cell lines. In HEK293T and SU-DHL-2 cells, we demonstrated that Fbw7 interacts with Stat3 and pStat3(Tyr705) to regulate their ubiquitylation and degradation. Downstream anti-apoptotic target genes of activated Stat3, including Myc, Survivin, Mcl-1, Pim-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl showed decreased mRNA expression following exogenous Fbw7 overexpression. The negative relationship between Fbw7 and pStat3(Tyr705) levels was also confirmed in DLBCL patient samples.CONCLUSION: The ubiquitin-ligase Fbw7 mediates apoptosis through targeting Stat3 for ubiquitylation and degradation in ABC-DLBCL. Thus, our study may offer a promising approach for ABC-DLBCL therapy through Stat3 inhibition.	NA	2
28070830	Mesenchymal subtype of glioblastomas with high DNA-PKcs expression is associated with better response to radiotherapy and temozolomide.	A better understanding of the relationship between glioblastomas molecular subtypes and radio-chemotherapy is needed for the development of individualized strategies. In this study, we aimed to assess whether non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) protein expression is associated and could predict responses to treatment of mesenchymal (MES) and proneural (PN) subtypes. Tumors from 122 patients with a glioblastoma treated at the University Hospital of Poitiers between 2002-2013 by an association of radiotherapy and temozolomide were collected. Among these tumors, 80 were suitable for in situ analysis and were included in TissueMicroArray. The expression of DNA-PKcs, Ku70, Ku80 and CD44, Olig2 (respectively surrogate markers of MES and PN subtypes) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The median survival of patients with high and low CD44 expression was 11.9 months (95% CI 7.7-14) and 19.1 months (95% CI 15.2-22.4) respectively (p = 0.008). Median survival of patients with high and low DNA-PKcs levels was 20.0 months (95% CI 15.2-25.3) and 12.9 months (95% CI 9.9-19.5) respectively (p = 0.036). High levels of Olig2, Ku70 and Ku80 tended to be associated with better overall survival but no significant differences were found. Overall survival of class I patients (CD44+ and DNA-PKcs+) was longer than class II (CD44+ and DNA-PKcs- or CD44- and DNA-PKcs+) and class III (CD44- and DNA-PKcs-), (p = 0.005 and 0.003 respectively). High levels of CD44 and DNA-PK are associated with a better survival and better response to radiotherapy and temozolomide and could establish prognosis classes by predicting survival and response to therapy for GBMs patients.

28070829	Functional analysis of KIF20A, a potential immunotherapeutic target for glioma.	Kinesin family member 20A (KIF20A), an ideal cancer-testis antigen, was reported to be a promising immunotherapeutic target for pancreatic cancers. Clinical trials of KIF20A peptide vaccine immunotherapy have been conducted against pancreatic cancers. To demonstrate the efficacy of KIF20A as a candidate molecular target for gliomas, we analyzed the expression and function of KIF20A in gliomas. Western blot and quantitative PCR analyses showed that KIF20A expression in glioma cell lines and glioma tissues was high compared with that found in a normal brain. KIF20A immunostaining of glioma cells and glioma tissues demonstrated that KIF20A was involved in spindle formation and cytokinesis, and that KIF20A was highly expressed, especially in glioma cells undergoing mitosis. In silico analysis of a cancer microarray database revealed that KIF20A was highly expressed in gliomas depending on the pathological grade, and glioma patients with higher expression of KIF20A showed poorer prognosis. Down-regulating KIF20A reduced cell proliferation in glioma cells due to the failure of cytokinesis and generation of binucleated cells. Additionally, KIF20A inhibition induced significant apoptosis in SF126 glioma cells. Taken together, KIF20A is a tumor-associated antigen involved in the glioma cell growth and cell survival, suggesting that KIF20A is an oncoantigen of gliomas. Thus, KIF20A is a candidate novel immunotherapeutic target for gliomas.	NA	2
28070828	Hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery for pituitary metastases.	Pituitary metastases (PMs) are uncommon, representing only 1% of pituitary lesions. The diagnosis of PMs can be challenging and an optimal management remains to be determined. Here, we present a pilot clinical study on the efficacy and safety of hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with an optimized dosimetric plan in treating PMs. Between June 2013 and December 2014, seven consecutive patients (4 men and 3 women; median age 62 years) had been diagnosed with PMs based on their characteristic clinical and radiological features and subsequently treated using hypofractionated SRS. Primary cancers originated from the lung (n = 5) or the breast (n = 2). All patients presented with diabetes insipidus (DI). Anterior pituitary and visual dysfunction were combined in 4 and 3 patients, respectively. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PMs involved the pituitary stalk and/or the posterior lobe in all patients. SRS of a cumulative marginal dose 31 Gy with dose-volume constraints for the optic apparatus was delivered in 5 daily fractions. As results, tumor was locally controlled in all patients with substantial responses on MRI (including complete remission in 4 patients). The median survival time was 14 months (range, 6-24 months) after SRS. DI and visual dysfunction improved in all patients, although anterior pituitary dysfunction did not recover. No patients experienced any deterioration in visual, pituitary, or other cranial nerve functions. These results suggest a promising role of hypofractionated SRS in treating PMs in terms of both tumor control and functional outcomes.	NA	0
28073847	Identification of CCR2 and CD180 as Robust Pharmacodynamic Tumor and Blood Biomarkers for Clinical Use with BRD4/BET Inhibitors.	PURPOSE: AZD5153 is a novel BRD4/BET inhibitor with a distinctive bivalent bromodomain binding mode. To support its clinical development, we identified pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers for use in clinical trials to establish target engagement.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CCR2 and CD180 mRNAs, initially identified from whole transcriptome profiling, were further evaluated by quantitative PCR in hematologic cell lines, xenografts, and whole blood from rat, healthy volunteers, and patients with cancer. MYC and HEXIM1 mRNAs were also evaluated.RESULTS: RNA-sequencing data showed consistent decreases in CCR2/CD180 expression across multiple hematologic cell lines upon AZD5153 treatment. Evaluation of dose dependence in MV4,11 cells confirmed activity at clinically relevant concentrations. In vivo downregulation of CCR2/CD180 mRNAs (&gt;80%) was demonstrated in MV4,11 and KMS-11 xenograft tumors at efficacious AZD5153 doses. Consistent with in vitro rat blood data, an in vivo rat study confirmed greater inhibition of CCR2/CD180 mRNA in whole blood versus MYC at an efficacious dose. Finally, in vitro treatment of whole blood from healthy volunteers and patients with cancer demonstrated, in contrast to MYC, almost complete downregulation of CCR2/CD180 at predicted clinically achievable concentrations.CONCLUSIONS: Our data strongly support the use of CCR2 and CD180 mRNAs as whole blood PD biomarkers for BRD4 inhibitors, especially in situations where paired tumor biopsies are unavailable. In addition, they can be used as tumor-based PD biomarkers for hematologic tumors. MYC mRNA is useful as a hematologic tumor-based biomarker but suboptimal as a whole blood biomarker. Utility of HEXIM1 mRNA may be limited to higher concentrations. Clin Cancer Res; 1-11. ©2017 AACR.	NA	2
28073846	Extended Treatment with Single-Agent Ibrutinib at the 420 mg Dose Leads to Durable Responses in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma.	PURPOSE: Ibrutinib, a first-in-class, once-daily, oral inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase, promotes apoptosis, and inhibits B-cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. Ibrutinib has demonstrated single-agent efficacy and acceptable tolerability at doses of 420 and 840 mg in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who were treatment-naïve (TN) or had relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL after ≥1 prior therapy in a phase Ib/II study (PCYC-1102). Subsequently, the ibrutinib 420 mg dose was approved in CLL.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We report data with 44 months of follow-up on 94 patients with TN and R/R CLL/SLL receiving ibrutinib 420 mg once-daily in PCYC-1102 and the long-term extension study PCYC-1103.RESULTS: Ninety-four CLL/SLL patients (27 TN, 67 R/R) were treated with ibrutinib (420 mg/day). Patients with R/R disease had received a median of four prior therapies (range, 1-12). Responses were rapid and durable and median duration of response was not reached. Best overall response was 91% [85% TN (complete response, CR 26%) and 94% R/R (9% CR)]. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached in either group. The 30-month PFS rate was 96% and 76% for TN and R/R patients, respectively. Ibrutinib was well tolerated with extended follow-up; rates of grade ≥3 cytopenias and fatigue, as well as discontinuations due to toxicities decreased over time.CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent ibrutinib at 420 mg once-daily resulted in durable responses and was well tolerated with up to 44 months follow-up in patients with TN and R/R CLL/SLL. Currently, 66% of patients continue on ibrutinib. Clin Cancer Res; 1-7. ©2017 AACR.	NA	0
28073845	Agreement between Programmed Cell Death Ligand-1 Diagnostic Assays across Multiple Protein Expression Cut-Offs in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.	PURPOSE: agents:Immunotherapies targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) demonstrate encouraging antitumor activity and manageable tolerability in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially in patients with high tumor PD-L1 expression, as detected by companion or complementary diagnostic assays developed for individual agents. A laboratory is unlikely to use multiple assay platforms. Furthermore, commercially available diagnostic assays are not standardized and different assay methods could lead to inappropriate treatment selection. This study establishes the extent of concordance between three validated, commercially available PD-L1 immunohistochemistry diagnostic assays for NSCLC patients (Ventana SP263 [durvalumab], Dako 22C3 [pembrolizumab], and Dako 28-8 [nivolumab]).EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Five-hundred formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival NSCLC samples were obtained from commercial sources. Stained slides were read in batches on an assay-by-assay basis by a single pathologist trained in all methods, in a Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments program-certified laboratory. An additional pathologist performed an independent review of 200 stained samples for each assay.RESULTS: PD-L1 expression was evaluable with all assays in 493 samples. The three assays showed similar patterns of tumor membrane staining, with high correlation between percentage PD-L1 staining. An overall percentage agreement of &gt;90% was achieved between assays at multiple expression cut-offs, including 1%, 10%, 25%, and 50% tumor membrane staining.CONCLUSIONS: This study builds optimism that harmonization between assays may be possible, and that the three assays studied could potentially be used interchangeably to identify patients most likely to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapies, provided the appropriate clinically defined algorithm and agent are always linked.

28073844	FDA Approval of Nivolumab for the First-Line Treatment of Patients with BRAFV600 Wild-Type Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma.	On November 23, 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved nivolumab (OPDIVO®, Bristol Myers Squibb, Co.) as a single agent for the first-line treatment of patients with BRAFV600 wild-type, unresectable or metastatic melanoma. An international, double-blind, randomized (1:1) trial conducted outside of the U.S. allocated 418 patients to receive nivolumab 3mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks (n=210) or dacarbazine 1000mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks (n=208). Patients with disease progression who met protocol-specified criteria (~25% of each trial arm) were permitted to continue with the assigned treatment in a blinded fashion until further disease progression is documented. Overall survival (OS) was statistically significantly improved in the nivolumab arm compared to the dacarbazine arm [HR 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.30-0.60; p &lt; 0.0001]. Progression-free survival was also statistically significantly improved in the nivolumab arm (HR 0.43: 95% CI, 0.34-0.56; P &lt; 0.0001). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) of nivolumab were fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, rash, and pruritus. Nivolumab demonstrated a favorable benefit-risk profile compared to dacarbazine supporting regular approval; however, it remains unclear whether treatment beyond disease progression contributes to the overall clinical benefit of nivolumab.	therapeutic	1
28073843	Active estrogen receptor-alpha signaling in ovarian cancer models and clinical specimens.	PURPOSE: High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is an aggressive disease with few available targeted therapies. Despite high expression of estrogen receptor-alpha in ~80% of HGSOC and some small but promising clinical trials of endocrine therapy, estrogen receptor-alpha has been understudied as a target in this disease. We sought to identify hormone-responsive, estrogen receptor-alpha-dependent HGSOC.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We characterized endocrine response in HGSOC cells across culture conditions (2-D, 3-D, forced suspension) and in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) explants, assessing proliferation and gene expression. Estrogen-regulated transcriptome data were overlapped with public datasets to develop a comprehensive panel of estrogen receptor-alpha target genes. Expression of this panel and estrogen receptor-alpha H-score were assessed in HGSOC samples from patients who received endocrine therapy. Time on endocrine therapy was used as a surrogate for clinical response.RESULTS: Proliferation is estrogen receptor-alpha-regulated in HGSOC cells in vitro and in vivo, and is partly dependent on 3-D context. Transcriptomic studies identified genes shared by cell lines and PDX explants as estrogen receptor-alpha targets. The selective estrogen receptor-alpha down-regulator (SERD) fulvestrant is more effective than tamoxifen in blocking estrogen receptor-alpha action. Estrogen receptor-alpha H-score is predictive of efficacy of endocrine therapy, and this prediction is further improved by inclusion of target gene expression, particularly IGFBP3.CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory models corroborate intertumor heterogeneity of endocrine response in HGSOC but identify features associated with functional estrogen receptor-alpha and endocrine responsiveness. Assessing estrogen receptor-alpha function (e.g. IGFBP3 expression) in conjunction with H-score may help select patients who would benefit from endocrine therapy. Preclinical data suggest that SERDs might be more effective than tamoxifen.	therapeutic	1
28073842	Expression of CD14, IL-10 and tolerogenic signature in dendritic cells inversely correlate with response to TARP vaccination in prostate cancer patients.	PURPOSE: Despite the vast number of clinical trials conducted so far, Dendritic cell (DC)-based cancer vaccines have mostly shown unsatisfactory results. Factors and manufacturing procedures essential for these therapeutics to induce effective anti-tumor immune responses have yet to be fully characterized. We here aimed to identify DC markers correlating with clinical and immunological response in a prostate carcinoma vaccination regimen.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed an extensive characterization of DCs used to vaccinate 18 prostate carcinoma patients enrolled in a pilot trial of TCR gamma alternate reading frame protein (TARP) peptide vaccination (NCT00908258). 114 peptide-pulsed DC preparations manufactured were analyzed by gene expression profiling, cell surface marker expression and cytokine release secretion and correlated with clinical and immunological responses.RESULTS: DCs showing lower expression of tolerogenic gene signature induced strong antigen-specific immune response and slowing in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) velocity, a surrogate for clinical response. These DCs were also characterized by lower surface expression of CD14, secretion of IL-10 and MCP-1; and greater secretion of MDC. When combined, these four factors were able to remarkably discriminate DCs that were sufficiently potent to induce strong immunological response.CONCLUSIONS: DC factors essential for the activation of immune responses associated with TARP vaccination in prostate cancer patients were identified. This study highlights the importance of in-depth characterization of DC vaccines - and other cellular therapies, to understand the critical factors that hinder potency and potential efficacy in patients.

28073841	Activation of EIF4E by Aurora kinase A depicts a novel druggable axis in everolimus resistant cancer cells.	PURPOSE: In this study, we investigated the role of Aurora kinase A (AURKA) in regulating EIF4E, cap-dependent translation, and resistance to mTOR inhibitor, RAD001 (everolimus).EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor xenografts and in vitro cell models of upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas (UGCs) were used to determine the role of AURKA in activation of EIF4E and cap-dependent translation. Overexpression, knockdown, and pharmacologic inhibition of AURKA were used in vitro and in vivo.RESULTS: Using in vitro cell models, we found that high protein levels of AURKA mediate phosphorylation of EIF4E and upregulation of c-MYC. Notably, we detected overexpression of endogenous AURKA in everolimus-resistant UGC cell models. AURKA mediated phosphorylation of EIF4E, activation of cap-dependent translation, and an increase in c-MYC protein levels. Targeting AURKA using genetic knockdown or a small molecule inhibitor, alisertib, reversed these molecular events, leading to a decrease in cancer cell survival in acquired and intrinsic resistant cell models. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that AURKA binds to and inactivates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a negative regulator of EIF4E, leading to activation of EIF4E and resistance to everolimus in an AKT-, ERK1/2-, and mTOR-independent manner. Data from tumor xenograft mouse models confirmed that everolimus-resistant cancer cells are sensitive to alisertib.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that AURKA plays an important role in activation of EIF4E and cap-dependent translation. Targeting AURKA-EIF4E-c-MYC axis using alisertib is a novel therapeutic strategy that can be applicable for everolimus-resistant tumors and/or subgroups of cancers that show overexpression of AURKA and activation of EIF4E and c-MYC.	therapeutic	1
28073840	FDA Approval Summary: Sonidegib for Locally Advanced Basal Cell Carcinoma.	On July 24, 2015, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved sonidegib (ODOMZO®, Novartis) for treatment of patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (laBCC) not amenable to curative surgery or radiation therapy. The approval was based on data from one randomized, double-blind, non-comparative trial of two doses of sonidegib administered to 230 hedgehog inhibitor-naïve patients with metastatic basal cell carcinoma (mBCC, n=36) or laBCC (n=194). Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive sonidegib 800 mg (n=151) or 200 mg (n=79) daily. The objective response rate (ORR) for patients with laBCC was 58% [95% confidence interval (CI): 45, 70] in the 200 mg group and 44% (95% CI: 35, 53) in the 800 mg group. The median duration of response (DoR) for patients with laBCC was non- estimable (NE) in the 200 mg arm and 15.7 months (95% CI: NE) in the 800 mg arm. The ORR for patients with mBCC was 8% (95% CI: 0.2, 36)] and 17% (95% CI: 5, 39)] in patients treated with 200 and 800 mg respectively. The most common AEs occurring in ≥10% of patients were muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia, nausea, fatigue, increased serum creatine kinase (CK), decreased weight, and diarrhea.	NA	0
28073839	Unsupervised clustering of quantitative image phenotypes reveals breast cancer subtypes with distinct prognoses and molecular pathways.	PURPOSE: To identify novel breast cancer subtypes by extracting quantitative imaging phenotypes of the tumor and surrounding parenchyma, and to elucidate the underlying biological underpinnings and evaluate the prognostic capacity for predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS).METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging data of patients from a single-center discovery cohort (n=60) and an independent multi-center validation cohort (n=96). Quantitative image features were extracted to characterize tumor morphology, intra-tumor heterogeneity of contrast agent wash-in/wash-out patterns, and tumor-surrounding parenchyma enhancement. Based on these image features, we used unsupervised consensus clustering to identify robust imaging subtypes, and evaluated their clinical and biological relevance. We built a gene expression-based classifier of imaging subtypes and tested their prognostic significance in five additional cohorts with publically available gene expression data but without imaging data (n=1160).RESULTS: Three distinct imaging subtypes, i.e., homogeneous intratumoral enhancing, minimal parenchymal enhancing, and prominent parenchymal enhancing, were identified and validated. In the discovery cohort, imaging subtypes stratified patients with significantly different 5-year RFS rates of 79.6%, 65.2%, 52.5% (logrank P=0.025), and remained as an independent predictor after adjusting for clinicopathological factors (hazard ratio=2.79, P=0.016). The prognostic value of imaging subtypes was further validated in five independent gene expression cohorts, with average 5-year RFS rates of 88.1%, 74.0%, 59.5% (logrank P from &lt;0.0001 to 0.008). Each imaging subtype was associated with specific dysregulated molecular pathways that can be therapeutically targeted.CONCLUSION: Imaging subtypes provide complimentary value to established histopathological or molecular subtypes, and may help stratify breast cancer patients.

28073785	Safety and Efficacy of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant After PD-1 Blockade in Relapsed/Refractory Lymphoma.	Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies are being increasingly tested in patients with advanced lymphoma. Following treatment, many of those patients are likely to be candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). However, the safety and efficacy of HSCT may be affected by prior PD-1 blockade. We conducted an international retrospective analysis of 39 patients with lymphoma who received prior treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor, at a median time of 62 days (7-260) before HSCT. After a median follow-up of 12 months, the one-year cumulative incidences of grade 2-4 and grade 3-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were 44% and 23% respectively, while the one-year incidence of chronic GVHD was 41%. There were 4 treatment-related deaths, (1 from hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, 3 from early acute GVHD). In addition, 7 patients developed a non-infectious febrile syndrome shortly after transplant requiring prolonged courses of steroids. One-year overall and progression-free survival rates were 89% (95% CI, 74-96) and 76% (95% CI, 56-87), respectively. One-year cumulative incidences of relapse and non-relapse mortality were 14% (95% CI, 4-29) and 11% (95% CI, 3-23), respectively. Circulating lymphocyte subsets were analyzed in 17 patients. Compared with controls, patients previously treated with PD-1 blockade had significantly decreased PD-1+ T cells, and decreased ratios of T regulatory cells to conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells. In conclusion, HSCT after PD-1 blockade appears feasible with a low rate of relapse. However, there may be an increased risk of early immune toxicity, which could reflect long-lasting immune alterations triggered by prior PD-1 blockade.	NA	0
28077417	Aid is a key regulator of myeloid/erythroid differentiation and DNA methylation in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.	Recent studies have reported activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and ten-eleven-translocation (TET) family members regulate active DNA demethylation. Genetic alterations of TET2 occur in myeloid malignancies and hematopoietic specific loss of Tet2 induces aberrant hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal/differentiation, implicating TET2 as a master regulator of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Despite the functional link between AID and TET in epigenetic gene regulation, the role of AID loss in hematopoiesis and myeloid transformation remains to be investigated. Here, we show that Aid loss in mice leads to expansion of myeloid cells and reduced erythroid progenitors resulting in anemia, with dysregulated expression of Cebpa and Gata1, myeloid/erythroid lineage specific transcription factors. Consistent with data in the murine context, silencing of AID in human bone marrow (BM) cells skews differentiation towards myelomonocytic lineage. However, in contrast to Tet2 loss, Aid loss does not contribute to enhanced HSC self-renewal or cooperate with Flt3-ITD to induce myeloid transformation. Genome-wide transcription and differential methylation analysis uncover the critical role of Aid as a key epigenetic regulator. These results indicate that AID and TET2 share common effects on myeloid and erythroid lineage differentiation, however their role is non-redundant in regulating HSC self-renewal and in myeloid transformation.

28073783	Podoplanin expression in primary brain tumors induces platelet aggregation and increases risk of venous thromboembolism.	Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common in patients with brain tumors, and underlying mechanisms are unclear. We hypothesized that podoplanin, a sialomucin-like glycoprotein, increases the risk of VTE in primary brain tumors via its ability to induce platelet aggregation. Immunohistochemical staining against podoplanin and intratumoral platelet aggregates was performed in brain tumor specimens of 213 patients (mostly high-grade gliomas [89%]) included in the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study (CATS), a prospective observational cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed cancer or progressive disease aimed at identifying patients at risk of VTE. Platelet aggregation in response to primary human glioblastoma cells was investigated in vitro. During 2-year-follow-up, 29 (13.6%) patients developed VTE. One hundred and fifty-one tumor specimens stained positive for podoplanin (33 high expression, 47 medium expression, 71 low expression). Patients with podoplanin positive tumors had lower peripheral blood platelet counts (p&lt;0.001) and higher D-dimer levels (p&lt;0.001). Podoplanin staining intensity was associated with increasing levels of intravascular platelet aggregates in tumor specimens (p&lt;0.001). High podoplanin expression was associated with an increased risk of VTE (hazard ratio for high vs. no podoplanin expression: 5.71, 95%CI: 1.52-21.26; p=0.010), independently of age, sex and tumor type. Podoplanin positive primary glioblastoma cells induced aggregation of human platelets in vitro, which could be abrogated by an anti-podoplanin antibody. In conclusion, high podoplanin expression in primary brain tumors induces platelet aggregation, correlates with hypercoagulability, and is associated with increased risk of VTE. Our data indicate novel insights into the pathogenesis of VTE in primary brain tumors.	NA	0

28077802	NMI promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression via BDKRB2 and MAPK/ERK pathway.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent and aggressive malignant tumors. The involvement of N-myc (and STAT) interactor (NMI) and its possible functional mechanisms in HCC progression still remain to be elucidated. In this study, we found that NMI was overexpressed in metastatic HCC cell lines compared with non-metastatic ones; and the expression levels of NMI in the HCC samples with metastasis were higher than that in the non-metastatic specimens. Furthermore, NMI depletion significantly decreased HCC cell proliferation and invasiveness in vitro, and also inhibited tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo in nude mice models bearing human HCC. By contrast, NMI stable overexpression can enhance the malignant behaviors obviously. Moreover, we further verified that NMI promotes the expression of BDKRB2 and mediates the activation of MAPK/ERK signaling pathway according to the bidirectional perturbations of NMI expression in vivo or in vitro of HCC. Taken together, NMI is a pro-metastatic molecule and partially responsible for HCC tumor growth and motility. NMI could improve its downstream target BDKRB2 expression to induce ERK1/2 activation, and thereby further evoke malignant progression of HCC.	NA	2
28077801	Human papillomavirus type 16 E6 suppresses microRNA-23b expression in human cervical cancer cells through DNA methylation of the host gene C9orf3.	Oncogenic protein E6 of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is believed to involve in the aberrant methylation in cervical cancer as it upregulates DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) through tumor suppressor p53. In addition, DNA demethylating agent induces the expression of one of the HPV-16 E6 regulated microRNAs (miRs), miR-23b, in human cervical carcinoma SiHa cells. Thus, the importance of DNA methylation and miR-23b in HPV-16 E6 associated cervical cancer development is investigated. In the present study, however, it is found that miR-23b is not embedded in any typical CpG island. Nevertheless, a functional CpG island is predicted in the promoter region of C9orf3, the host gene of miR-23b, and is validated by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite genomic sequencing analyses. Besides, c-MET is confirmed to be a target gene of miR-23b. Silencing of HPV-16 E6 is found to increase the expression of miR-23b, decrease the expression of c-MET and thus induce the apoptosis of SiHa cells through the c-MET downstream signaling pathway. Taken together, the tumor suppressive miR-23b is epigenetically inactivated through its host gene C9orf3 and this is probably a critical pathway during HPV-16 E6 associated cervical cancer development.

28077799	KRAS and TP53 mutations in inflammatory bowel disease-associated colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis.	Although KRAS and TP53 mutations are common in both inflammatory bowel disease-associated colorectal cancer (IBD-CRC) and sporadic colorectal cancer (S-CRC), molecular events leading to carcinogenesis may be different. Previous studies comparing the frequency of KRAS and TP53 mutations in IBD-CRC and S-CRC were inconsistent. We performed a meta-analysis to compare the presence of KRAS and TP53 mutations among patients with IBD-CRC, S-CRC, and IBD without dysplasia. A total of 19 publications (482 patients with IBD-CRC, 4,222 with S-CRC, 281 with IBD without dysplasia) met the study inclusion criteria. KRAS mutation was less frequent (RR=0.71, 95%CI 0.56-0.90; P=0.004) while TP53 mutation was more common (RR=1.24, 95%CI 1.10-1.39; P&lt;0.001) in patients with IBD-CRC compared to S-CRC. Both KRAS (RR=3.09, 95%CI 1.47-6.51; P=0.003) and TP53 (RR=2.15, 95%CI 1.07-4.31 P=0.03) mutations were more prevalent in patients with IBD-CRC compared to IBD without dysplasia. In conclusion, IBD-CRC and S-CRC appear to have biologically different molecular pathways. TP53 appears to be more important than KRAS in IBD-CRC compared to S-CRC. Our findings suggest possible roles of TP53 and KRAS as biomarkers for cancer and dysplasia screening among patients with IBD and may also provide targeted therapy in patients with IBD-CRC.	NA	2
28077797	Repression of Fyn-related kinase in breast cancer cells is associated with promoter site-specific CpG methylation.	The triple-negative breast cancer subtype is highly aggressive and has no defined therapeutic target. Fyn-related kinase (FRK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, reported to be downregulated in breast cancer and gliomas, where it is suggested to have tumor suppressor activity. We examined the expression profile of FRK in a panel of 40 breast cancer cells representing all the major subtypes, as well as in 4 non-malignant mammary epithelial cell lines. We found that FRK expression was significantly repressed in a proportion of basal B breast cancer cell lines. We then determined the mechanism of suppression of FRK in FRK-low or negative cell lines. In silico analyses of the FRK promoter region led to the identification of at least 17 CpG sites. Bisulphite sequencing of the promoter region revealed that two of these sites were consistently methylated in FRK-low/negative cell lines and especially in the basal B breast cancer subtype. We further show that treatment of these cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors, Entinostat and Mocetinostat' promoted re-expression of FRK mRNA and protein. Further, using luciferase reporter assays, we show that both GATA3-binding protein FOG1 and constitutively active STAT5A increased the activity of FRK promoter. Together, our results present the first evidence that site-specific promoter methylation contributes to the repression of FRK more so in basal B breast cancers. Our study also highlights the potential clinical significance of targeting FRK using epigenetic drugs specifically in basal B breast cancers which are usually triple negative and very aggressive.

28077793	Integrated proteomic and N-glycoproteomic analyses of doxorubicin sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer cells reveal glycoprotein alteration in protein abundance and glycosylation.	Ovarian cancer is one of the most common cancer among women in the world, and chemotherapy remains the principal treatment for patients. However, drug resistance is a major obstacle to the effective treatment of ovarian cancers and the underlying mechanism is not clear. An increased understanding of the mechanisms that underline the pathogenesis of drug resistance is therefore needed to develop novel therapeutics and diagnostic. Herein, we report the comparative analysis of the doxorubicin sensitive OVCAR8 cells and its doxorubicin-resistant variant NCI/ADR-RES cells using integrated global proteomics and N-glycoproteomics. A total of 1525 unique N-glycosite-containing peptides from 740 N-glycoproteins were identified and quantified, of which 253 N-glycosite-containing peptides showed significant change in the NCI/ADR-RES cells. Meanwhile, stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) based comparative proteomic analysis of the two ovarian cancer cells led to the quantification of 5509 proteins. As about 50% of the identified N-glycoproteins are low-abundance membrane proteins, only 44% of quantified unique N-glycosite-containing peptides had corresponding protein expression ratios. The comparison and calibration of the N-glycoproteome versus the proteome classified 14 change patterns of N-glycosite-containing peptides, including 8 up-regulated N-glycosite-containing peptides with the increased glycosylation sites occupancy, 35 up-regulated N-glycosite-containing peptides with the unchanged glycosylation sites occupancy, 2 down-regulated N-glycosite-containing peptides with the decreased glycosylation sites occupancy, 46 down-regulated N-glycosite-containing peptides with the unchanged glycosylation sites occupancy. Integrated proteomic and N-glycoproteomic analyses provide new insights, which can help to unravel the relationship of N-glycosylation and multidrug resistance (MDR), understand the mechanism of MDR, and discover the new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

28077792	Prognostic value of the pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in cervical cancer: a meta-analysis and systematic review.	The prognostic value of pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in cervical cancer remains controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis based on the data from 13 studies with 3729 patients to evaluate the association between the pretreatment NLR and the clinical outcomes of overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with cervical cancer. The relationship between NLR and clinicopathological parameters was also assessed. Hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was used as the effect size estimate. Our analysis indicated that elevated pretreatment NLR was a poor prognostic marker for patients with cervical cancer because it predicted unfavorable overall survival (HR = 1.375, 95% CI: 1.200-1.576) and progression-free survival (HR = 1.646, 95% CI: 1.313-2.065). Increased NLR is also significantly associated with the larger tumor size (OR = 1.780, 95% CI: 1.090-2.908), advanced clinical stage (OR = 2.443, 95% CI: 1.730-3.451), and positive lymph node metastasis (OR = 2.380, 95% CI: 1.775-3.190). By these results, high pretreatment NLR predicted a shorter survival period for patients with cervical cancer, and it could be served as a novel index of prognostic evaluation in patients with cervical cancer.

28077791	Carcinoma-risk variant of EBNA1 deregulates Epstein-Barr Virus episomal latency.	Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) latent infection is a causative co-factor for endemic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC). NPC-associated variants have been identified in EBV-encoded nuclear antigen EBNA1. Here, we solve the X-ray crystal structure of an NPC-derived EBNA1 DNA binding domain (DBD) and show that variant amino acids are found on the surface away from the DNA binding interface. We show that NPC-derived EBNA1 is compromised for DNA replication and episome maintenance functions. Recombinant virus containing the NPC EBNA1 DBD are impaired in their ability to immortalize primary B-lymphocytes and suppress lytic transcription during early stages of B-cell infection. We identify Survivin as a host protein deficiently bound by the NPC variant of EBNA1 and show that Survivin depletion compromises EBV episome maintenance in multiple cell types. We propose that endemic variants of EBNA1 play a significant role in EBV-driven carcinogenesis by altering key regulatory interactions that destabilize latent infection.	NA	0
28077790	FLT3 activating mutations display differential sensitivity to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors.	Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that normally functions in hematopoietic cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. Constitutively activating mutations of FLT3 map predominately to the juxtamembrane domain (internal tandem duplications; ITD) or the activation loop (AL) of the kinase domain and are detected in about 1/3 of de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) effectively target FLT3/ITD mutations, but some activating mutations, particularly those on the AL, are relatively resistant to many FLT3 TKI. We reproduced many of the AL or other non-ITD activating mutations and tested 13 FLT3 TKI for their activity against these and wild-type FLT3. All 13 TKI tested inhibited BaF3/ITD cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner as reported, but most TKI exhibited a wide range of differential activity against AL and other point mutants. Western blotting results examining inhibition of FLT3 autophosphorylation and signaling pathways indicate that many AL mutations reduce TKI binding. Most FLT3 TKI effectively target wild-type FLT3 signaling. As a demonstration of this differential activity, treatment of BaF3 D835Y cells transplanted in BALB/c mice with sorafenib showed no effect in vivo against this mutant whereas lestaurtinib proved effective at reducing disease burden. Thus, while FLT3 TKI have been selected based on their ability to inhibit FLT3/ITD, the selection of appropriate TKI for AML patients with FLT3 AL and other activating point mutations requires personalized consideration.

28077789	Biological functions of CDK5 and potential CDK5 targeted clinical treatments.	Cyclin dependent kinases are proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinases that are traditionally activated upon association with a regulatory subunit. For most CDKs, activation by a cyclin occurs through association and phosphorylation of the CDK's T-loop. CDK5 is unusual because it is not typically activated upon binding with a cyclin and does not require T-loop phosphorylation for activation, even though it has high amino acid sequence homology with other CDKs. While it was previously thought that CDK5 only interacted with p35 or p39 and their cleaved counterparts, Recent evidence suggests that CDK5 can interact with certain cylins, amongst other proteins, which modulate CDK5 activity levels. This review discusses recent findings of molecular interactions that regulate CDK5 activity and CDK5 associated pathways that are implicated in various diseases. Also covered herein is the growing body of evidence for CDK5 in contributing to the onset and progression of tumorigenesis.	NA	2
28077788	Androgen receptor splice variants and prostate cancer: From bench to bedside.	Therapeutic interventions for advanced prostate cancer (PCa) center on inhibiting androgen receptor (AR) and downstream signaling pathways. Resistance to androgen deprivation therapy and/or AR antagonists is inevitable and molecular mechanisms driving castration-resistant PCa (CR-PCa) primarily involve alterations in AR expression and activity. Detailed molecular biology work over the past decade, discussed at length in this review article, has revealed several AR transcripts that result from alternative splicing. These AR splice variants are increased in cell and mouse models of CR-PCa and in CR-PCa tumors. Several AR variants lack the ligand binding domain, but retain their ability to bind DNA and activate transcription-linking constitutive AR function and therapeutic failure. ARV7 is the only variant endogenously detected at the protein level and thus has undergone more thorough molecular characterization. Clinical trials in PCa are currently investigating ARV7 utility as a biomarker and new therapeutics that inhibit ARV7 . Overall, this review will illustrate the historical perspectives of AR splice variant discovery using fundamental molecular biology techniques and how it changed the clinical approach to both therapeutic decisions and strategy. The body of work investigating AR splice variants in PCa represents a true example of translational research from bench to bedside.	NA	1
28077787	Androgen suppresses protein kinase D1 expression through fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 in prostate cancer cells.	In prostate cancer, androgen/androgen receptor (AR) and their downstream targets play key roles in all stages of disease progression. The protein kinase D (PKD) family, particularly PKD1, has been implicated in prostate cancer biology. Here, we examined the cross-regulation of PKD1 by androgen signaling in prostate cancer cells. Our data showed that the transcription of PKD1 was repressed by androgen in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells. Steroid depletion caused up regulation of PKD1 transcript and protein, an effect that was reversed by the AR agonist R1881 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, thus identifying PKD1 as a novel androgen-repressed gene. Kinetic analysis indicated that the repression of PKD1 by androgen required the induction of a repressor protein. Furthermore, inhibition or knockdown of AR reversed AR agonist-induced PKD1 repression, indicating that AR was required for the suppression of PKD1 expression by androgen. Downstream of AR, we identified fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) and its downstream MEK/ERK pathway as mediators of androgen-induced PKD1 repression. In summary, PKD1 was identified as a novel androgen-suppressed gene and could be downregulated by androgen through a novel AR/FRS2/MEK/ERK pathway. The upregulation of prosurvival PKD1 by anti-androgens may contribute to therapeutic resistance in prostate cancer treatment.	NA	2
28077786	Nomogram analysis and external validation to predict the risk of lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer.	AIM: To identify risk factors for lymph node metastasis using a nomogram for gastric cancer patients to predict lymph node metastasis.RESULTS: The Chi-square test and the logistic regression showed that the Boarrmann type, preoperative CA199 level, T stage and N stage by CT scan were independent risk factors. The concordance index (C-index) was 0.786 in the internal validation of the Nomogram model. In the external validation, the C-index was 0.809, and the AUC was 0.894. The total accuracy of the prediction was 82.2%, and the false-negative rate was 5.4% with a cut-off value set at 0.109.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 451 patients with a histological diagnosis of gastric cancer with 0 or 1 lymph node metastasis from the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center as the development set, and the validation set consisted of 186 gastric cancer patients from the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University. A Chi-square test and a logistic regression analysis were used to compare the clinicopathological variables and lymph node metastasis. The C-index and ROC curve were computed for comparisons of the nomogram's predictive ability.CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a nomogram to predict lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer before surgery. This nomogram can be broadly applied, even in general hospitals, and is useful for decisions regarding treatment programs for patients.	NA	0
28077785	The diagnostic performance of shear wave speed (SWS) imaging for thyroid nodules with elasticity modulus and SWS measurement.	To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a new technique of shear wave speed (SWS) imaging for the diagnosis of thyroid nodule with elasticity modulus and SWS measurement. 322 thyroid nodules in 322 patients (216 benign nodules, 106 malignant nodules) were included in this study. All the nodules received conventional ultrasound (US) and SWS imaging (Aplio500, Toshiba Medical Systems, Japan) before fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and/or surgery. The values of E-max and E-mean with elastic modulus (61.27 ± 36.31 kPa and 31.89 ± 19.11 kPa) or SWS (4.45 ± 1.49 m/s and 3.26 ± 2.71 m/s) in malignant nodules were significantly higher than those in benign lesions (29.18 ± 18.62 kPa and 15.85 ± 6.96 kPa, or 2.98 ± 0.85 m/s and 2.19 ± 0.42 m/s, all P &lt; 0.001). No significant differences in area under the curve (AUC) between the SWS imaging parameters were found (all P &gt; 0.05). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, E-max (m/s) with SWS was identified to be the strongest independent predictor for malignant nodules (odds ratio [OR] = 16.760), followed by poorly-defined margin (OR = 7.792), taller-than-wide shape (OR = 3.160), micro-calcification (OR = 2.422), and E-max (kPa) with elastic modulus (OR = 0.914). The AUC was 0.813 for E-max with SWS (m/s) and 0.796 for E-max with elastic modulus (kPa). With cut-off SWS value of 3.52 m/s in E-max, sensitivity of 69.8%, specificity of 81.5%, and accuracy of 77.6% were achieved. SWS imaging is a valuable tool in predicting thyroid malignancy. E-max with SWS measurement is the strongest independent predictor for thyroid malignancy.	NA	0
28077784	Identification and characterization of HPV-independent cervical cancers.	BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) initiates cervical cancer, and continuous expression of HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 is thought to be necessary to maintain malignant growth. Current therapies target proliferating cells, rather than specific pathways, and most experimental therapies specifically target E6/E7. We investigated the presence and expression of HPV in cervical cancer, to correlate HPV oncogene expression with clinical and molecular features of these tumors that may be relevant to new targeted therapies.RESULTS: While virtually all cervical cancers contained HPV DNA, and most expressed E6/E7 (HPV-active), a subset (8%) of HPV DNA-positive cervical cancers did not express HPV transcripts (HPV-inactive). HPV-inactive tumors occurred in older women (median 54 vs. 45 years, p = 0.02) and were associated with poorer survival (median 715 vs 3046 days, p = 0.0003). Gene expression profiles of HPV-active and -inactive tumors were distinct. HPV-active tumors expressed E2F target genes and increased AKT/MTOR signaling. HPV-inactive tumors had increased WNT/β-catenin and Sonic Hedgehog signaling. Substantial genome-wide differences in DNA methylation were observed. HPV-inactive tumors had a global decrease in DNA methylation; however, many promoter-associated CpGs were hypermethylated. Many inflammatory response genes showed promoter methylation and decreased expression. The somatic mutation landscapes were significantly different. HPV-active tumors carried few somatic mutations in driver genes, whereas HPV-inactive tumors were enriched for non-synonymous somatic mutations (p-value &lt; 0.0000001) specifically targeting TP53, ARID, WNT, and PI3K pathways.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cervical cancer data were analyzed.CONCLUSIONS: Many of the gene expression changes and somatic mutations found in HPV-inactive tumors alter pathways for which targeted therapeutics are available. Treatment strategies focused on WNT, PI3K, or TP53 mutations may be effective against HPV-inactive tumors and could improve survival for these cervical cancer patients.	NA	2
28077783	Association between metformin use and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and localized resectable pancreatic cancer: a nationwide population-based study in korea.	BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies support an antitumor effect of metformin. However, clinical studies have conflicting results and metformin's effect remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate metformin's effect on clinical outcomes in diabetic patients with pancreatic cancer treated with curative resection.RESULTS: A total of 764 patients underwent curative resection, met none of the exclusion criteria, and were prescribed oral hypoglycemic agents. The cancer-specific survival (5-year, 31.9% vs. 22.2%, p &lt; 0.001) was significantly higher in the 530 metformin users than in the 234 diabetic metformin non-users. After multivariable adjustments, metformin users had significantly lower cancer-specific mortality as compared with metformin non-users (hazard ratio, 0.727; 95% confidence interval, 0.611-0.868). Cubic spline regression analysis demonstrated significantly decreased cancer-specific mortality with increasing dose of metformin (p = 0.0047).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were provided from the Korea Central Cancer Registry and the National Health Insurance Service in the Republic of Korea. The study cohort consisted of 28,862 patients newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer between 2005 and 2011. Metformin exposure was determined from prescription information from 6 months before the first diagnosis of pancreatic cancer to last follow-up. The main outcome was cancer-specific survival.CONCLUSIONS: This large study indicates that metformin might decrease cancer-specific mortality rates in localized resectable pancreatic cancer patients with pre-existing diabetes, independently of other factors, with a dose-response relationship.

28077782	Serum and tissue markers in hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma: clinical and prognostic implications.	HCC represents the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Despite the high incidence, treatment options for advanced HCC remain limited and unsuccessful, resulting in a poor prognosis. Despite the major advances achieved in the diagnostic management of HCC, only one third of the newly diagnosed patients are presently eligible for curative treatments. Advances in technology and an increased understanding of HCC biology have led to the discovery of novel biomarkers. Improving our knowledge about serum and tissutal markers could ultimately lead to an early diagnosis and better and early treatment strategies for this deadly disease. Serum biomarkers are striking potential tools for surveillance and early diagnosis of HCC thanks to the non-invasive, objective, and reproducible assessments they potentially enable. To date, many biomarkers have been proposed in the diagnosis of HCC. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive malignancy, characterized by early lymph node involvement and distant metastasis, with 5-year survival rates of 5%-10%. The identification of new biomarkers with diagnostic, prognostic or predictive value is especially important as resection (by surgery or combined with a liver transplant) has shown promising results and novel therapies are emerging. However, the relatively low incidence of CCA, high frequency of co-existing cholestasis or cholangitis (primary sclerosing cholangitis -PSC- above all), and difficulties with obtaining adequate samples, despite advances in sampling techniques and in endoscopic visualization of the bile ducts, have complicated the search for accurate biomarkers. In this review, we attempt to analyze the existing literature on this argument.	NA	2
28076853	Pyruvate dehydrogenase expression is negatively associated with cell stemness and worse clinical outcome in prostate cancers.	Cells generate adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP), the major currency for energy-consuming reactions, through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis. One of the remarkable features of cancer cells is aerobic glycolysis, also known as the &quot;Warburg Effect&quot;, in which cancer cells rely preferentially on glycolysis instead of mitochondrial OXPHOS as the main energy source even in the presence of high oxygen tension. One of the main players in controlling OXPHOS is the mitochondrial gatekeeperpyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) and its major subunit is E1α (PDHA1). To further analyze the function of PDHA1 in cancer cells, it was knock out (KO) in the human prostate cancer cell line LnCap and a stable KO cell line was established. We demonstrated that PDHA1 gene KO significantly decreased mitochondrial OXPHOS and promoted anaerobic glycolysis, accompanied with higher stemness phenotype including resistance to chemotherapy, enhanced migration ability and increased expression of cancer stem cell markers. We also examined PDHA1 protein expression in prostate cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry and observed that reduced PDHA1 protein expression in clinical prostate carcinomas was significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Collectively, our results show that negative PDHA1 gene expressionis associated with significantly higher cell stemness in prostate cancer cells and reduced protein expression of this gene is associated with shorter clinical outcome in prostate cancers.

28076852	miR-874-3p is down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and negatively regulates PIN1 expression.	PIN1 is a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) that regulates multiple signaling pathways to control cell fate and is found to be over-expressed in cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the regulation of PIN1 in HCC remains poorly defined. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to play a pivotal role in oncogenesis by targeting the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs encoded by oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, thereby suppressing the levels of both oncoproteins and tumour suppressors. In this report, we aimed to identify miRNAs that suppress PIN1 expression and to determine their role in HCC. By searching the TargetScan database, miR-874-3p was identified as a potential negative regulator of PIN1. miR-874-3p was demonstrated to bind the 3'UTR of PIN1 mRNA directly to suppress expression of PIN1. Functionally, over-expression of miR-874-3p in HCC cell line PLC/PRF/5 inhibited cell growth and colony formation in-vitro, and promoted cellular apoptosis. Furthermore, these tumour suppressive functions conferred by miR-874-3p were abrogated by over-expression of PIN1. Similarly, expression of miR-874-3p in PLC/PRF/5 with PIN1 knocked-down did not further suppress cellular proliferation, suggesting that PIN1 was a major target of miR-874-3p. More importantly, miR-874-3p was found to be down-regulated in HCC tissues and its expression was negatively correlated with that of PIN1. Down-regulation of miR-874-3p was also associated with poorly differentiated tumour cells, more advanced staging, and inferior patient outcomes. In addition, over-expression of miR-874-3p suppressed tumour growth in vivo. Taken together, our data suggested that miR-874-3p plays a tumour suppressive role in HCC through down-regulation of PIN1.

28076850	Transforming growth factor-beta1 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation via activation of Hippo signaling.	In this study, we examined the expression of core proteins of the Hippo signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells treated with transforming growth factor-β 1(TGF-β1) and investigated the relationship between TGF-β1 and the Hippo signaling pathway, in order to better understand their roles in HCC and their potential implications for cancer therapy. We prove that the Hippo signaling pathway is involved in the TGF-β1-induced inhibition of the growth of HCC cells. Large tumor suppressor expression (LATS1) was overexpression and yes association protein 1(YAP1) translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in HCC cells treated with TGF-β1. Overexpression of LATS1 and the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of YAP1 play an anti-oncogenetic role in the occurrence and development of liver cancer. Our findings provide new insight into strategies for liver cancer therapy.	NA	2
28076849	A plasma metabolomic signature discloses human breast cancer.	PURPOSE: Metabolomics is the comprehensive global study of metabolites in biological samples. In this retrospective pilot study we explored whether serum metabolomic profile can discriminate the presence of human breast cancer irrespective of the cancer subtype.METHODS: Plasma samples were analyzed from healthy women (n = 20) and patients with breast cancer after diagnosis (n = 91) using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry platform. Multivariate statistics and a Random Forest (RF) classifier were used to create a metabolomics panel for the diagnosis of human breast cancer.RESULTS: Metabolomics correctly distinguished between breast cancer patients and healthy control subjects. In the RF supervised class prediction analysis comparing breast cancer and healthy control groups, RF accurately classified 100% both samples of the breast cancer patients and healthy controls. So, the class error for both group in and the out-of-bag error were 0. We also found 1269 metabolites with different concentration in plasma from healthy controls and cancer patients; and basing on exact mass, retention time and isotopic distribution we identified 35 metabolites. These metabolites mostly support cell growth by providing energy and building stones for the synthesis of essential biomolecules, and function as signal transduction molecules. The collective results of RF, significance testing, and false discovery rate analysis identified several metabolites that were strongly associated with breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: In breast cancer a metabolomics signature of cancer exists and can be detected in patient plasma irrespectively of the breast cancer type.

28076847	Programmed cell death-ligand 1 expression predicts survival in patients with gastric carcinoma with microsatellite instability.	Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed in a subgroup of gastric cancers that may benefit from immunotherapy. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) is a potential predictive factor for response to immunotherapy targeting the PD-1 or its ligand PD-L1. The relationship between PD-L1 expression and MSI-H status remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated PD-L1 expression in patients with MSI-H gastric cancer. We analyzed PD-L1 expression in 78 MSI-H gastric cancer tissue samples using immunohistochemistry. PD-L1 expression was classified as expression on tumor cells or on immune cells. We observed PD-L1 expression in 48 gastric cancer samples (61.5%), consisting of 7 (9.0%) cases with tumor PD-L1 expression and 47 (60.3%) cases with immune cell PD-L1 expression. Immune cell PD-L1 expression was frequently associated with intestinal type cancer by the Lauren classification (p = 0.015), with a lower risk of lymph node metastasis (p = 0.027) and lower tumor stages (p = 0.029) compared to MSI-H gastric cancers without PD-L1 expression. Moreover, immune cell PD-L1 expression was an independent favorable prognostic factor for overall survival (versus PD-L1 negative; hazard ratio, 3.451; 95% confidence interval, 1.172-12.745; p = 0.025). In MSI-H gastric cancer, PD-L1 expression was observed to be independently associated with a longer survival.	NA	2
28076845	Molecular dynamics simulation reveals how phosphorylation of tyrosine 26 of phosphoglycerate mutase 1 upregulates glycolysis and promotes tumor growth.	Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) catalyzes the eighth step of glycolysis and is often found upregulated in cancer cells. To test the hypothesis that the phosphorylation of tyrosine 26 residue of PGAM1 greatly enhances its activity, we performed both conventional and steered molecular dynamics simulations on the binding and unbinding of PGAM1 to its substrates, with tyrosine 26 either phosphorylated or not. We analyzed the simulated data in terms of structural stability, hydrogen bond formation, binding free energy, etc. We found that tyrosine 26 phosphorylation enhances the binding of PGAM1 to its substrates through generating electrostatic environment and structural features that are advantageous to the binding. Our results may provide valuable insights into computer-aided design of drugs that specifically target cancer cells with PGAM1 tyrosine 26 phosphorylated.	NA	2
28076843	Pax-5 is a potent regulator of E-cadherin and breast cancer malignant processes.	Pax-5, an essential transcription factor for B lymphocyte development, has been linked with the development and progression of lymphoid cancers and carcinoma. In contrast to B-cell cancer lesions, the specific expression signatures and roles of Pax-5 in breast cancer progression are relatively unknown. In the present study, we set out to profile Pax-5 expression in mammary tissues and elucidate the cellular and molecular roles of Pax-5 in breast cancer processes. Using immunohistology on mammary tissue arrays, Pax-5 was detected in a total of 298/306 (97.6%) samples tested. Interestingly, our studies reveal that Pax-5 inhibits aggressive features and confers anti-proliferative effects in breast carcinoma cells in contrast to its oncogenic properties in B cell cancers. More precisely, Pax-5 suppressed breast cancer cell migration, invasion and tumor spheroid formation while concomitantly promoting cell adhesion properties. We also observed that Pax-5 inhibited and reversed breast cancer epithelial to mesenchymal phenotypic transitioning. Mechanistically, we found that the Pax-5 transcription factor binds and induces gene expression of E-cadherin, a pivotal regulator of epithelialisation. Globally, we demonstrate that Pax-5 is predominant expressed factor in mammary epithelial cells. We also present an important role for Pax-5 in the phenotypic transitioning processes and aggressive features associated with breast cancer malignancy and disease progression.	NA	2
28076842	Systemically identifying and prioritizing risk lncRNAs through integration of pan-cancer phenotype associations.	LncRNAs have emerged as a major class of regulatory molecules involved in normal cellular physiology and disease, our knowledge of lncRNAs is very limited and it has become a major research challenge in discovering novel disease-related lncRNAs in cancers. Based on the assumption that diverse diseases with similar phenotype associations show similar molecular mechanisms, we presented a pan-cancer network-based prioritization approach to systematically identify disease-specific risk lncRNAs by integrating disease phenotype associations. We applied this strategy to approximately 2800 tumor samples from 14 cancer types for prioritizing disease risk lncRNAs. Our approach yielded an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 80.66%, with the highest AUC (98.14%) for medulloblastoma. When evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) for prioritization of disease candidate genes, the average AUC score of 97.16% was achieved. Moreover, we demonstrated the robustness as well as the integrative importance of this approach, including disease phenotype associations, known disease genes and the numbers of cancer types. Taking glioblastoma multiforme as a case study, we identified a candidate lncRNA gene SNHG1 as a novel disease risk factor for disease diagnosis and prognosis. In summary, we provided a novel lncRNA prioritization approach by integrating pan-cancer phenotype associations that could help researchers better understand the important roles of lncRNAs in human cancers.

28076841	Clonal evolution in therapy-related neoplasms.	Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) may occur as a late effect of cytotoxic therapy for a primary malignancy or autoimmune diseases in susceptible individuals. We studied the development of somatic mutations in t-MN, using a collection of follow-up samples from 14 patients with a primary hematologic malignancy, who developed a secondary leukemia (13 t-MN and 1 t-acute lymphoblastic leukemia), at a median latency of 73 months (range 18-108) from primary cancer diagnosis.Using Sanger and next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches we identified 8 mutations (IDH1 R132H, ASXL1 Y591*, ASXL1 S689*, ASXL1 R693*, SRSF2 P95H, SF3B1 K700E, SETBP1 G870R and TP53 Y220C) in seven of thirteen t-MN patients (54%), whereas the t-ALL patient had a t(4,11) translocation, resulting in the KMT2A/AFF1 fusion gene. These mutations were then tracked backwards in marrow samples preceding secondary leukemia occurrence, using pyrosequencing and a NGS protocol that allows the detection of low variant allele frequencies (≥0.1%).Somatic mutations were detectable in the BM harvested at the primary diagnosis, prior to any cytotoxic treatment in three patients, while they were not detectable and apparently acquired by the t-MN clone in five patients.These data show that clonal evolution in t-MN is heterogeneous, with some somatic mutations preceding cytotoxic treatment and possibly favoring leukemic development.

28076840	HIF-1α induces the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gastric cancer stem cells through the Snail pathway.	Substantial evidence suggests that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype is associated with the invasive characteristics of cancer stem cells (CSCs),which possess an EMT phenotype that may predominate in tumor invasion and metastasis. However, the mechanisms for the generation and regulation of these CSCs have not been clearly defined. As hypoxia and EMT-related factors may have important functions in EMT-like CSCs, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hypoxia on these cells. CSCs were established from the gastric cancer cell lines MGC-803 and SGC7901, and the relationship between hypoxia and EMT-like CSCs was investigated in gastric cancer. After hypoxia treatment, some gastric CSCs exhibited a marked increase in hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)expression and increased migration and invasion capabilities compared with the normoxic control. These CSCs were defined by activation of the mesenchymal cell marker Vimentin and by inhibition of the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin. Our analyses also show that HIF-1α was responsible for activating EMT via increased expression of the transcription factor Snail in gastric CSCs. Moreover, inhibition of Snail by shRNA reduced HIF-1α-induced EMT in gastric CSCs. The results demonstrated that hypoxia-induced EMT-like CSCs rely on HIF-1αto activate Snail, which may result in recurrence and metastasis of gastric cancer.	NA	0
28076334	Establishment of a normal-derived estrogen receptor-positive cell line comparable to the prevailing human breast cancer subtype.	Understanding human cancer increasingly relies on insight gained from subtype specific comparisons between malignant and non-malignant cells. The most frequent subtype in breast cancer is the luminal. By far the most frequently used model for luminal breast cancer is the iconic estrogen receptor-positive (ERpos) MCF7 cell line. However, luminal specific comparisons have suffered from the lack of a relevant non-malignant counterpart. Our previous work has shown that transforming growth factor-β receptor (TGFβR) inhibition suffices to propagate prospectively isolated ERpos human breast luminal cells from reduction mammoplasties (HBEC). Here we demonstrate that transduction of these cells with hTERT/shp16 renders them immortal while remaining true to the luminal lineage including expression of functional ER (iHBECERpos). Under identical culture conditions a major difference between MCF7 and normal-derived cells is the dependence of the latter on TGFβR inhibition for ER expression. In a breast fibroblast co-culture model we further show that whereas MCF7 proliferate concurrently with ER expression, iHBECERpos form correctly polarized acini, and segregate into proliferating and ER expressing cells. We propose that iHBECERpos may serve to shed light on hitherto unappreciated differences in ER regulation and function between normal breast and breast cancer.	NA	0
28076332	Lysosomal acid phosphatase 2 is an unfavorable prognostic factor but is associated with better survival in stage II colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading cancers worldwide. Surgery is the main therapeutic modality for stage II CRC. However, the implementation of adjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial and is not universally applied so far. In this study, we found that the protein expression of lysosomal acid phosphatase 2 (ACP2) was increased in CRC and that stage II CRC patients with high ACP2 expression showed a poorer outcome than those with low ACP2 expression (p = 0.004). To investigate this discrepancy, we analyzed the relation between ACP2 expression and several clinical cofactors.Among patients who received chemotherapy, those with an high expression of ACP2 showed better survival in both stage II and III CRC than those with low ACP2 expression. In stage II CRC patients, univariate analysis showed ACP2 expression and T stage to be cofactors significantly associated with overall survival (ACP2: p = 0.006; T stage: p = 0.034). Multivariate Cox proportion hazard model analysis also revealed ACP2 to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (ACP2: p = 0.006; T stage: p = 0.041). Furthermore, ACP2-knockdown CRC cells showed an increase in chemoresistance to 5-FU treatment and increased proliferation marker in the ACP2 knockdown clone.Taken together, our results suggested that ACP2 is an unfavorable prognostic factor for stage II CRC and may serve as a potential chemotherapy-sensitive marker to help identify a subset of stage II and III CRC patients for whom chemotherapy would improve survival.Highlights1. To the best of our knowledge, the study is the first report to show ACP2 overexpression in human colorectal cancer (CRC) and its association with poor outcome in stage II CRC.2. Patients with stage II and III CRCs with high expression of ACP2 were more sensitive to chemotherapy than those with a low expression.3. ACP2 expression may serve as a marker for CRC patients receiving chemotherapy and help identify the subset of CRC patients who would benefit from chemotherapy.	NA	2
28076330	The correlation of age with chemotherapy-induced ovarian function failure in breast cancer patients.	PURPOSE: To assess the incidence of chemotherapy-induced ovarian function failure (COFF) based on estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) monitoring in premenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer treated with second and third generation (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy.RESULTS: We identified 115 eligible women. Two years after start of chemotherapy, COFF was significantly more often present in women ≥ 40 years (85.6%) as compared to women &lt; 40 years (8.7%). Only age was significantly associated with COFF two years after start of chemotherapy (HR 12.26; 95% CI 5.21-28.86). In 50% of the patients, premenopausal hormone levels were the first or only evidence of ovarian function recovery (OFR).MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included all premenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, with or without taxanes, in our university hospital in the Netherlands in the years 2005-2013. Patients were 3-monthly monitored for ovarian function. Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the predictive impact of various parameters on the occurrence of COFF.CONCLUSIONS: After second- or third generation (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy, COFF was still present in 8.7% of patients &lt; 40 years after two years. FSH and estradiol monitoring may be relevant for those in whom ovarian function suppression is considered an additional effective endocrine treatment.	NA	0
28076329	Feasibility of abbreviated cycles of immunochemotherapy for completely resected limited-stage CD20+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (CISL 12-09).	BACKGROUND: The appropriate number of chemotherapy cycles for limited stage diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients without gross residual lesions after complete resection, has not been specifically questioned. We performed a multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 study to investigate the feasibility of 3 cycles of abbreviated R-CHOP chemotherapy in low-risk patients with completely resected localized CD20+ DLBCL.RESULTS: Between December 2010 and May 2013, we recruited 23 patients. One was excluded due to ineligibility, and hence, 22 were included in the final analysis. The primary sites comprised the intestine (n = 15), cervical lymph nodes (n = 4), stomach (n = 1), tonsil (n = 1), and spleen (n = 1). All patients successfully completed the 3 cycles of planned R-CHOP chemotherapy. Over a median follow-up of 39.5 months (95% confidence interval, 29.9-47.1 months), both the estimated 2-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates was 95% confidence interval, 85.9-104.1%. Only one patient with an international prognostic index of 2 experienced relapse and died. The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicity condition included neutropenia (n = 8, 36.4%). Three patients experienced grade 3 febrile neutropenia, but no grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity was observed.MATERIALS AND METHODS: DLBCL patients without residual lesions after resection were enrolled and R-CHOP chemotherapy was repeated at 3-week-intervals over 3 cycles. The primary endpoint was 2-year disease-free survival.CONCLUSIONS: Three cycles of abbreviated R-CHOP immunochemotherapy is feasible for completely resected low risk localized DLBCL.	NA	0
28076328	Albumin to gamma-glutamyltransferase ratio as a prognostic indicator in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma after curative resection.	The prognosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) remains poor whereas predictive models for survival prediction in ICC patients following curative resection are limited. Herein, we established a novel inflammation-based score derived from preoperative albumin to gamma-glutamyltransferase ratio (AGR) and evaluated its prognostic significance in ICC patients underwent curative resection. Prognostic value of AGR was retrospectively studied in a cohort comprising 206 ICC patients following curative resection. The predictive performance of AGR was compared with other inflammation-based scores and serological tumor markers in terms of concordance index (C-index). Further, prognostic nomograms incorporating AGR into the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging systems were established to achieve a better discriminatory ability. The optimal cut-off value of AGR was 0.6. Multivariate analysis showed that AGR was an independent predictor for overall survival (OS; P = 0.003) and recurrence-free survival (RFS; P = 0.046). The C-index of AGR was superior to other inflammation-based scores and serological tumor markers in OS and RFS prediction. The established nomograms showed improved predictive accuracy compared with the TNM staging systems alone. These results indicate that AGR is an independent prognostic indicator for ICC underwent curative resection. The incorporation of AGR into the existing TNM staging systems achieved improved predictive accuracy.	NA	0
28076327	MiR-410 induces stemness by inhibiting Gsk3β but upregulating β-catenin in non-small cells lung cancer.	Our previous research indicated miR-410 played a critical role in promoting the tumorigenesis and development of NSCLC (non-small cells lung cancer). MiR-410 has been recently reported to be crucial for development and differentiation of embryonic stem cells. But it remains elusive whether miR-410 stimulates the stemness of cancer until now. Herein, we identify miR-410 induces the stemness and is associated with the progression of NSCLC. We demonstrate miR-410 increases the levels of stem cells marker Sox2, Oct4, Nanog, CXCR4 as well as lung cancer stem cells surface marker CD44 and CD166. MiR-410 promotes stem cells-like properties such as proliferation, sphere formation, metastasis and chemoresistance. Moreover, Gsk3β is directly targeted and post-transcriptionally downregulated by miR-410. Also, the expression levels of miR-410 and Gsk3β may be correlated to clinicopathological differentiation in NSCLC tumor specimens. Additionally, we demonstrate miR-410 induces stemness through inhibiting Gsk3β but increasing Sox2, Oct4, Nanog and CXCR4, which binds to β-catenin signaling. In conclusion, our findings identify the miR-410/Gsk3β/β-catenin signaling axis is a novel molecular circuit in inducing stemness of NSCLC.	NA	2
28076326	Cytosolic THUMPD1 promotes breast cancer cells invasion and metastasis via the AKT-GSK3-Snail pathway.	Human THUMP domain-containing protein 1 (THUMPD1) is a specific adaptor protein that modulates tRNA acetylation through interaction with NAT10. Immunohistochemical analysis of 146 breast cancer specimens (82 triple-negative and 64 non-triple-negative cases) indicated THUMPD1 expression is higher in breast cancer tissues (60.9%, 89/146) than normal breast tissues (28.3%, 15/53; p &lt; 0.001). Overall and cytosolic, but not nuclear, THUMPD1 expression in breast cancer correlated with advanced TNM stage (p = 0.003 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively), and poor patient prognosis (p = 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). THUMPD1 interacted and co-localized with YAP, but did not affect Hippo pathway activity. THUMPD1 overexpression enhanced breast cancer cells invasion and migration in vivo and in vitro, possibly through activation of AKT, GSK3β and Snail, and inhibition of E-cadherin. Treatment with the AKT inhibitor, LY294002, reduced the effects of THUMPD1 overexpression in breast cancer cells. These results indicate that THUMPD1 promotes breast cancer cells invasion and migration via the AKT-GSK3β-Snail pathway.	NA	2
28076325	Identification of long noncoding RNAs for the detection of early stage lung squamous cell carcinoma by microarray analysis.	The aberrant expressions of long noncoding RNAs have been reported in numerous cancers, which have facilitated the cancer diagnosis. However, the expression profile of lncRNAs in early stage lung squamous cell carcinoma has not been well discussed. The present study aimed to examine the expression profile of lncRNAs in early stage lung squamous cell carcinoma and identify lncRNA biomarkers for diagnosis. Through high-throughput lncRNA microarray, we screened thousands of aberrantly expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in early stage lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues compared to their corresponding adjacent nontumorous tissues. Bioinformatics analyses were used to investigate the functions of aberrantly expressed mRNAs and their associated lncRNAs. After that, in order to identify lncRNA biomarkers for early detection, candidate lncRNA biomarkers were selected based on our established filtering pipeline and validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction on a total of 63 pairs of tumor samples. Five lncRNAs were finally identified which were able to distinguish early stage tumor and normal samples with high sensitivity (92%) and specificity (83%). These results imply that lncRNAs may be powerful biomarker for early diagnosis.	NA	2
28076324	Poly(C)-binding protein 1 mediates drug resistance in colorectal cancer.	Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) is standard treatment for colorectal cancer. However, resistance to L-OHP often leads to treatment failure or cancer relapse. Understanding of the mechanism underlying L-OHP resistance is important to overcome the resistance and improve colorectal cancer treatment. This study aimed to identify new proteins that mediates L-OHP resistance in colorectal cancer and elucidate their mode of function. HT-29 cells were exposed to gradually increased concentration of L-OHP to select L-OHP resistant HT-29/L-OHP cell line. Proteomic analysis of HT-29 and HT-29/L-OHP cells were performed to identify differentially expressed proteins, including Poly(C)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1). PCBP1 expression level in 20 cases of L-OHP sensitive patients and 20 cases of L-OHP refractory patients was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Chemoresistance and Akt activation in HT-29 and HT-29/L-OHP cells were analyzed by MTT assay and Western blot analysis. We identified 37 proteins showing differential expression in HT-29/L-OHP and HT-29 cells. In particular, PCBP1 protein level increased 15.6 fold in HT-29/L-OHP cells compared to HT-29 cells. Knockdown of PCBP1 sensitized HT-29/L-OHP and HT-29 cells to L-OHP, while overexpression of PCBP1 increased L-OHP resistance in HT-29 cells. In addition, PCBP1 expression was significantly higher in tumor samples from L-OHP refractory patients than in those from L-OHP responsive patients. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of PCBP1 inhibited the activation of Akt in HT-29/L-OHP and HT-29 cells. In conclusion, our findings suggest that PCBP1 is a molecular marker of L-OHP resistance in colorectal cancer and a promising target for colorectal cancer therapy.	therapeutic	1
28076323	Clinical outcome of tyrosine kinase inhibitors alone or combined with radiotherapy for brain metastases from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).	This study compared treatment outcomes between TKI monotherapy and TKI administration combined with brain radiotherapy (TKI + RT) in 133 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with brain metastasis (BM). We also evaluated the association of different epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation subtypes with treatment outcome. To screen for potential variables affecting cranial progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), we performed univariate and multivariate analysis based on Cox proportional-hazards models. Median cranial PFS and OS were longer for the TKI + RT group (n = 67) than TKI alone group (n = 66). Intracranial metastasis correlated with a better median OS than extracranial metastasis. For patients with exon 21 mutations, TKI + RT yielded a better median OS and cranial PFS than TKI alone. However, there were no significant differences in median OS and cranial PFS between the two treatment groups for patients with exon 19 deletions. Thus EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with BM could benefit more from TKI + RT than from TKI monotherapy, especially when they suffer from exon 21 mutations. However, TKI + RT confers no advantage over TKI treatment alone for patients with exon 19 deletions. These results underscore the urgent need to develop individualized disease management strategies in clinical practice.	NA	2
28076321	Secretion modification region-derived peptide blocks exosome release and mediates cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cells.	PURPOSE: Discovery and development of a novel anticancer PEG-SMR-Clu peptide to prevent breast cancer metastasis. How breast cancer cells and primary mammary epithelial cells interact and communicate with each other to promote tumorigenesis and how to prevent tumor metastasis has long been a concern of researchers. Cancer cells secrete exosomes containing proteins and RNA. These factors can influence tumor development by directly targeting cancer cells and tumor stroma. In this study, we determined the effects of a peptide as an inhibitor of exosome secretion on breast tumors. We developed a peptide derived from the Secretion Modification Region (SMR) of HIV-1 Nef protein that was modified with PEG on the N-terminus and with a Clusterin (Clu)-binding peptide on the C-terminus. Attachment of PEG to the SMR peptide, termed PEGylation, offers improved water solubility and stability as well as reduced clearance through the kidneys, leading to a longer circulation time. The 12-mer Clu-binding peptide plays multiple roles in tumor development and metastasis. The Clu peptide can be detected by antibody in vivo, thus it has the potential to be used to monitor tumor status and treatment efficacy in animal studies and eventually in cancer patients.RESULTS: PEG-SMRwt-Clu and PEG-SMRwt peptides inhibited the growth of both of MCF-7 (estrogen responsive, ER+) and MDA-MD-231 (estrogen non-responsive, ER-) human breast cancer cells in a dose and time-dependent manner, without inducing cytotoxic effects. The SMRwt peptide, combined with paclitaxel, induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells but did not promote apoptosis. PEG-SMRwt-Clu peptide treatment blocked exosome release from both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. This effect was blocked by knockdown of the chaperone protein mortalin by either antibody or siRNA.MATERIALS AND METHODS: MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells were treated with PEG-SMR-Clu peptide alone and in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin. Cell proliferation and viabilty were determined via cell cycle analysis using Cellometer imaging cytometry, Annexin V and MTT assays. The effects of the PEG-SMR-Clu peptide on tumor exosome release were determined by testing isolated exosome fractions, for (i) expression of CD63 and Alix proteins by Western blotting, (ii) NanoSight nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA 10) to measure exosomes size and concentration, and (iii) measurement of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) for exosome specific enzyme activity.CONCLUSIONS: PEG-SMRwt-CLU peptides inhibited the growth of human breast cancer cells and blocked tumor exosome release in vitro. The peptide alone did not cause increased cytotoxicity or apoptosis induction, but did cause cell cycle G2/M phase arrest in both estrogen responsive and non-responsive breast cancer cells. These data suggest a potential therapeutic value of SMR to prevent breast cancer metastasis and as an adjuvant for the chemotherapeutic treatment of human breast cancer.	NA	0
